:labname: Deploy-Time Policy Enforcement

:numbered:

== Introduction to {labname}

In this lab, you explore how Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) can prevent the deployment of applications that violate workflow, configuration, or security best practices before they become actively running containers.

There are two approaches to enforcing deploy-time policies in RHACS:

* In clusters with _listen_ and _enforce_ AdmissionController options enabled, RHACS uses the admission controller to reject deployments that violate policy.
* In clusters where the enforcement option is disabled, RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.

In this lab, the enforcement action output that is documented assumes that the AdmissionController deployment is created with the listen and enforce options enabled.

.Goals

* Prevent unscanned images from deployment
* Prevent misuse of environment variables at deploy time

== Prevent Unscanned Images from Deployment

RHACS can block the deployment of container images that were not scanned for vulnerabilities either by the RHACS Scanner or other, third-party vulnerability scanners.
Enforcing the use of vulnerability scanning is an important part of general security practices and in industry and regulatory standards like NIST 800-190, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA.

=== Configure Admission Controller

Using admission controller enforcement for image-based scanning requires enabling the AdmissionController deployment and configuring it to contact image scanners.

.Procedure
. Verify that admission controller and image scanning are set up properly by navigating to *Platform Configuration -> Clusters -> Production* and verifying that the following settings are enabled:
+
image::rhacs_deploytime_admission_controler.png[RHACS Admission Controller Listen and Enforce Enabled]
image::rhacs_deploytime_image_scanner.png[RHACS Image Scanning Enabled]
+
CAUTION: Before configuring this lab, be aware that enforcing this policy blocks all deployments that use images for which RHACS Central cannot retrieve results.
For more information, review the RHACS help for Scanner and Image Registries.

. Navigate to *Platform Configuration -> System Policies*, find the `Images with no scans` policy, and select it to open the side panel.
. On the first page, click *Edit* (pencil) and enable the policy. This policy rejects attempts to deploy an image that has no scanning status.
+
. On your student VM, use Kubernetes to deploy a deliberately nonsensical image with no scans:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project test
oc run nonsense --image=test-nonsense:latest
----
+
RHACS evaluates the policy and the Kubernetes admission controller rejects the new deployment:
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request:
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Images with no scans
- Description:
    ↳ Alert on deployments with images that have not been scanned
- Rationale:
    ↳ Without a scan, there be no vulnerability information for this image
- Remediation:
    ↳ Configure the appropriate registry and scanner integrations so that StackRox can
      obtain scans for your images.
- Violations:
    - Image in container 'nonsense' has not been scanned

In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
----
+
If RHACS is deployed without the admission controller webhook, RHACS still enforces the policy and scales down the deployment to `0` replicas:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get events
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options='nowrap']

== Enforce Deploy-Time Policy on Misuse of Environment Variables

In this section, you explore using RHACS to prevent the deployment of applications that mishandle sensitive data (such as account keys, certificates, or passwords).

Container-based microservices applications face challenges when providing sensitive information like passwords to running containers. For example, an e-commerce application may have an order status microservice that needs to read records from a database that requires a username and password to execute queries. It is a critical security practice to keep passwords private.

Unfortunately, several methods for distributing secrets that have come into common use fail to protect sensitive content or restrict access to secrets. One of these insecure methods is to store sensitive data in the clear in Kubernetes deployment YAML files. This section demonstrates how RHACS can bring this misuse to light and encourage a developer to use a proper secrets management method.

RHACS also has a separate feature for visibility into the Kubernetes Secrets feature, a method for distributing secrets to deployments natively in Kubernetes. For more information, see the RHACS documentation.

This section demonstrates two separate enforcement points for policies: at build time (perhaps as part of a CI/CD job) and at deployment time in a Kubernetes cluster.

.Procedure
. Create the following Deployment manifest on your student VM:
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << EOF >$HOME/secrets.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
  labels:
    app: ubuntu
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubuntu
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ubuntu
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu:18.04
        env:
            - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
              value: "abcdefg"
EOF
----
+
. In the *Platform Configuration -> Policy Management* page of the RHACS web console, locate the `Environment Variable Contains Secret` policy.
. Click the `Actions` drop down and enable the policy.
+
At build time, the `roxctl` binary can be used to _preview_ the Deployment before actually attempting to create it in a Kubernetes cluster.
+
. Supply the file containing this YAML to `roxctl` on your student VM to run the Deployment check:
+
[source,sh]
----
roxctl -e $ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443 deployment check --file ./secrets.yaml --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
+
. Among the policy violations, review the output and expect to see the following:
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options="nowrap"]

== Summary

In this lab, you explored how RHACS can prevent the deployment of applications that violate workflow, configuration, or security best practices before they become actively running containers.

You saw how to use the AdmissionController with the listen and enforce options enabled to reject deployments that violate policy.

In clusters where the enforcement option is disabled, you saw how RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.
