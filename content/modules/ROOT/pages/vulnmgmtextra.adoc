=== RHACS Vulnerability Scanner

RHACS' Scanner v4 is a built-in vulnerability scanner that breaks down images into layers and components - where components can be operating-system installed packages or dependencies installed by programming languages like Python, Javascript, Go, Java and more. The *Image Summary tab* provides the essential security details of the image overall, with links to the components. Below, you can see why the image is ranked as a critically vulnerable application:

- In the *Details and metadata* â†’ Image Summary panel, the information you see there tells you that this image has a severe security problem - the base image was imported several years ago (Debian 9).
- At the top of the page is the warning that CVE data is stale - that this image has a base OS version whose distribution has stopped providing security information and likely stopped publishing security fixes. ACS will still scan for language issues even if the Operating System does not have CVE data available.


.Procedure
. Scroll down the page to the *Image Findings* section.

Here you find the details of the image vulnerabilities. There are 82 vulnerabilities detected with 80 of those vulnerabilities listed as fixable (at the time of the creation of this workshop.)

. Above the *Image Findings* section, click on the *Dockerfile* tab:

The Dockerfile tab view shows the layer-by-layer view, and, as you can see, the most recent layers are also several years old. Time is not kind to images and components - as vulnerabilities are discovered, RHACS will display newly discovered CVEs. The layers that are listed as *Source=OS* are not showing CVE data since the CVE feeds are stale or do not have any information. However, the Python libraries that are added to the container are showing vulnerabilities. For example, the 'mercurial' package in the four layers.
