= Policy Management

== Module goals
* Create build, deploy and runtime policies 
* Create policies from filters
* Clone and edit policies based on the ACS defaults

== RHACS Policy Management Basics

RHACS has many built-in policies to detect activity related to attacker goals: gain a foothold, maintain a presence, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. The continuous runtime monitoring observes all container activity and will automatically respond to events with appropriate enforcement and notification. However, that would be missing out on an opportunity - RHACS wants to go one step further, to take advantage of containers' ephemeral, immutable nature, to improve security in a measurable way.

We want to use runtime incidents and vulnerabilities as a learning opportunity to improve security going forward by constraining how our containers can act. We achieve this by creating policies and implementing them early in the CI/CD process.

As we move into this next section, let's focus on identifying and enforcing a runtime policy in the cluster. For the upcoming example, we will focus on stopping the Ubuntu package manager from being run on pods in our cluster. Our example container *ctf-web-to-system* has this package manager in the container. Let's ensure that it never calls for updates while present in our clusters.

== Introduction to Runtime Policy Creation and Enforcement

RHACS observes container processes and collects this information to enable you to craft policies to prevent behavior that you don’t like. This information can also create baseline policy configurations that the user can update. Runtime policies can include build-time and deploy-time policy criteria but they can also include data about process executions during runtime. However, runtime policies that use “audit logs” event source cannot use build and deploy criteria at all as they are Kubernetes specific events.

The example below demonstrates how security may want to block a package manager from downloading any packages to the container. This runtime enforcement option is the first in the process of shifting left. After runtime enforcement, you will want to stop the package manager from being used in the container altogether.

IMPORTANT: For the Runtime stage, RHACS stops all pods that match the conditions of the policy. It does not scale the deployment down to zero.

.Procedure
. On the left-hand side of the application, click the *Platform Configuration* tab and select *Policy Management*.

image::acs-policy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Dashboard]

[start=2]

. Filter through the policies to find *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* or use the search bar to select *Policy*.

image::acs-policy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Search]

[start=3]

. Once you have found the policy *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution*, click on it to learn more.

image::acs-policy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Details]

NOTE: If you click the actions button, you will see how easy it is to edit, clone, export or disable these policies. We also recommended cloning the policies and adding or removing specific filters as you need them.

=== Prevent execution of package manager binary

Package managers like apt (Ubuntu), apk (Alpine), or yum/dnf (RedHat) are binary software components used to manage and update installed software on a Linux® host system. They are used extensively to manage running virtual machines. However, using a package manager to install or remove software on a running container violates the immutable principle of container operation.

This policy demonstrates how RHACS detects and avoids a runtime violation, using Linux kernel instrumentation to detect the running process and OpenShift® to terminate the pod for enforcement. Using OpenShift to enforce runtime policy is preferable to enforcing rules directly within containers or in the container engine, as it avoids a disconnect between the state that OpenShift is maintaining and the state where the container is operating. Furthermore, because a runtime policy may detect only part of an attacker’s activity inside a container, removing the container avoids the attack.

=== Enable enforcement of policy

[start=4]

. Click the *Actions* button, then click *Edit policy*.

image::acs-runtime-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Select *Policy Behavior -> Actions*

image::acs-runtime-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]

. Enable runtime enforcement by clicking the *inform and enforce* button.
. Configure enforcement behavior by selecting *Enforce at Runtime*.

image::acs-runtime-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Enforce Runtime Policy]

[start=8]

. Go to the *Review* tab
. Review the changes
. Click save

IMPORTANT: Make sure to save the policy changes! If you do not save the policy, the process will not be blocked!

=== Testing the configured policy

Next, we will use tmux to watch OpenShift events while running the test so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you are signed into the bastion host with OpenShift access when running the following commands. 

.Procedure
. In the terminal,  start tmux with two panes:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; attach
----

[start=2]

. Next, run a watch on OpenShift events in the first shell pane:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get events -w
----

[start=3]

. Press Ctrl+b *THEN* o to switch to the next pane. (Hold ctrl+b then press o)
. Exec into our Java application by getting the pod details and adding them to the following command.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
POD=$(oc get pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
oc exec $POD -i --tty -- /bin/bash
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ POD=$(oc get pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
oc exec $POD -i --tty -- /bin/bash
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-hz6j2:/app$
----

NOTE: If you see *node@ctf...* you've confirmed you have a shell and access to the Java application.

[start=5]
. Run the Ubuntu package manager in this shell:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
apt update
----

[start=6]
. Examine the output and expect to see that the package manager attempts to perform an update operation:

*Sample output*
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-stwhq:/$ apt update
Reading package lists... Done
E: List directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial is missing. - Acquire (13: Permission denied)
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-stwhq:/$ command terminated with exit code 137
----

[start=7]
. Examine the oc get events tmux pane (The pane on the bottom), and note that it shows that RHACS detected the package manager invocation and deleted the pod:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
0s          Normal    Killing                  pod/ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-hz6j2    Stopping container ctf-web-container

----

NOTE: After a few seconds, you can see the pod is deleted and recreated. In your tmux shell pane, note that your shell session has terminated and that you are returned to the Bastion VM command line.

*Congrats!* 

You have successfully stopped yourself from downloading malicious packages! However, the security investigative process continues, as you have now raised a flag that must be triaged! We will triage our violations later in this module.

NOTE: Type *exit* in the terminal, use *ctrl+c* to stop the 'watch' command, and type exit one more time to get back to the default terminal.

CONTENT -> Worth talking about the differences in enforcement?


== Introduction to deploy-time policy enforcement

Deploy-time policy refers to enforcing configuration controls in the cluster and before deployment in the CI/CD process and the configuration of applications inside the cluster. Deploy-time policies can include all build-time policy criteria, but they can also include data from your cluster configurations, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker socket.

There are two approaches to enforcing deploy-time policies in RHACS:

- In clusters with **listen** and **enforce** AdmissionController options enabled, RHACS uses the admission controller to reject deployments that violate policy.
- In clusters where the admission controller option is disabled, RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.

In the next example, we are going to configure a *Deploy-Time* policy to block applications from deploying into the default namespace with the *apt|dpkg* application in the image.

=== Prevent the Ubuntu Package Manager in the ctf-web-to-system image from being deployed

. Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy* then *Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.

NOTE: This time we are going to edit a different policy. Specifically related to the *Build & Deploy* phases.

[start=3]

. Click on the *Ubuntu Package Manager in Image* options (The three dots on the right side of the screen) and select *Clone policy*

IMPORTANT: Make sure to *CLONE* the policy. Cloning policies ensure the defaults don't change.

image::acs-deploy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]

. Give the policy a new name. Something you will remember. The best practice would be to add a description for future policy enforcers as well. For example;

image::acs-deploy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Next, update the policy by clicking on the *Build* stage so that only the Deploy stage is selected.

image::acs-deploy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: Make sure to unselect the *Build* lifecycle before moving forward. This will trigger an alert!

image::acs-deploy-021.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

We will have to add the policy criteria back. This is because certain actions can only be done in the build, deploy, or runtime stages.

Now, we want to target our specific deployment with an image label.

[start=6]
. Click on the *Rules* tab.
. Click on the *Image contents* dropdown on the right side of the browser.
. Find the *Image component* label and drag it to the default policy criteria.
. Type *apt-get* under the criteria

Your policy should look like this,

image::acs-deploy-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=10]

. In Policy behavior -> Actions, click *Inform and enforce*.

image::acs-deploy-044.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=11]
. Lastly, go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes

NOTE: There is a preview tab on the right side of the page that will show you all of the affected applications with the introduction of this policy.

image::acs-deploy-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=12]

. *Click Save*

Now, let's test it out! We're going to deploy a simple Ubuntu application to the cluster.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

[start=13]
. Next, apply the deployment manifest.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f ubuntu-deployment.yml

The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Ubuntu Package Manager in Image - Deploy
- Description:
 ↳ Alert on deployments with components of the Debian/Ubuntu package management
 system in the image.
- Rationale:
 ↳ Package managers make it easier for attackers to use compromised containers,
 since they can easily add software.
- Remediation:
 ↳ Run `dpkg -r --force-all apt apt-get && dpkg -r --force-all debconf dpkg` in the
 image build for production containers.
- Violations:
 - Container 'ubuntu' includes component 'apt' (version 2.7.14build2)
 - Container 'ubuntu' includes component 'dpkg' (version 1.22.6ubuntu6)

In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number

*Congrats!* 

You're now enforcing against the Ubuntu package manager at runtime and deploy time. Let's finish with enforcing at build-time!

== Introduction to build-time policy enforcement 

Build time policies for container images are guidelines that define how container images should be constructed. These policies aim to achieve several goals, including:

* *Security:* Minimizing vulnerabilities and ensuring images are built with secure practices.
* *Efficiency:* Reducing image size and build times for faster deployments.
* *Consistency:* Maintaining a uniform structure and content across all images.
Here are some key areas covered by build time policies:
* *Base Image:* Specifying a minimal base image that only contains essential components.
* *Package Management:* Encouraging the use of package managers for dependency installation and updates.
* *File Copying:* Limiting what gets copied into the image to only required files and avoiding unnecessary bloat.
* *User Management:* Defining a non-root user for the application process to run as.
* *Environment Variables:* Storing sensitive information in environment variables outside the image.

In RHACS, build-time policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.

NOTE: Now RHACS hasn't broken the command since there is no enforcement of any build policies. 

Let's make a copy of the build & deploy-time policy and enforce it during the build phase.

.Procedure
. Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy* then *Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.
. Click on the *Ubuntu Package Manager in Image* options (The three dots on the right side of the screen) and select *Clone policy*

IMPORTANT: Make sure to *CLONE* the policy

image::acs-deploy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]

. Give the policy a new name. Something you will remember. The best practice would be to add a description for future policy enforcers as well. For example;

image::05-build-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Next, update the policy to *inform and enforce* while ensuring the Build stage checkbox is selected And select Enforce on Build at the bottom of the page.

image::05-build-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]
. At the policy scope tab, make sure there are no exclusions or inclusions.
. Lastly, go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes.
. Click *Save*

Now let's test it out! 

. Run the following in the terminal.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

IMPORTANT: You should see the same violations from the previous command EXCEPT now you have a failed policy check. This woruld send an exit 0 command if this was run in any pipeline.

AMAZING!

In summary, we made use of the features provided by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes to display potential security violations in your cluster in a central dashboard. You crafted both deploy-time and runtime policies to help prevent malicious events from occurring in our cluster. Hopefully this lab has helped demonstrate to you the immense value provided by RHACS and OpenShift Platform Plus. Please feel free to continue and explore the RHACS lab environment.

On to *CI/CD and Automation*!
