== Module 11: Trusted Software Supply Chain

=== Goal of Module 11

The goal of this lab is to learn about the features from the Trusted Software Supply Chain suite of products from Red Hat. 


=== Trusted Artifact Signer
Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer(TAS) enhances software supply chain security by simplifying cryptographic signing and verification of software artifacts, such as container images, binaries, and documents. Trusted Artifact Signer provides a production-ready deployment of the Sigstore project in Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain.



=== Trusted Profile Analyzer 
The Trusted Profile Analyzer adds management capabilities for *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to OpenShift. 

==== *What is an SBOM?* 
https://www.cisa.gov[CISA.gov] defines an SBOM as "a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components." https://www.cisa.gov/sbom[¹] 

Using SBOMs, you can have a clear vision of everything that goes into your application or what you may have received from vendors, such as Red Hat. This enables platform engineers to more easily enforce operational controls and compliance across hybrid multi-cloud environments. 

In addition, several regulatory requirements and frameworks either *mandate* or *recommend* the use of *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to enhance software supply chain transparency and security. Here are some key examples, but the list is continually growing:


==== *1. U.S. Executive Order 14028 (Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity)*

* *Mandate*: In May 2021, this Executive Order directed the U.S.
government to take actions to secure the software supply chain.
* *SBOM Requirement*:
** The *National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA)* was tasked with defining minimum elements for SBOMs.
** Vendors providing software to federal agencies must provide SBOMs as
part of their cybersecurity practices.
** Goal: Increase transparency about software components to mitigate
risks from vulnerabilities.



==== *2. EU Cyber Resilience Act*

* *Proposed Mandate*: Expected to become law in the near future, this
act will apply to products with digital elements in the EU.
* *SBOM Requirement*: It encourages or requires organizations to
maintain transparency about their software dependencies, including
SBOMs, for compliance with security standards.



==== *3. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance*

* *Recommendation*: The FDA issued guidance for medical device
manufacturers to include SBOMs.
* *Context*: As part of the *Pre-market Cybersecurity Guidance* for
medical devices, manufacturers are encouraged to provide SBOMs to
identify vulnerabilities in device software and support risk management.
* *Goal*: Protect healthcare systems and patient safety.


==== *4. OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS)*

* *Recommendation*: OWASP promotes SBOMs as part of software composition
analysis (SCA) to track components and identify vulnerabilities.
* *Context*: Although not a regulatory requirement, it is widely
recognized in cybersecurity best practices.



==== *5. CISA Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 23-01*

* *Mandate*: U.S. government agencies are required to track and mitigate
known vulnerabilities in software they use.
* *SBOM Role*: Although the directive doesn’t explicitly mandate SBOMs,
managing them is critical to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
efficiently.



==== *6. ISO/IEC 5962 (SBOM Standard)*

* *Recommendation*: This international standard formalizes SBOM
structure, ensuring consistent implementation across industries. It
supports compliance with regulatory and industry standards requiring
software transparency.



==== *7. Proposed SEC Cybersecurity Rules*

* *Recommendation*: Companies under U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) regulations must report cybersecurity risks, including
supply chain vulnerabilities. SBOMs can help meet these transparency
requirements.



==== *Why SBOMs are Becoming Standard in Regulations*

* *Transparency*: Knowing what’s in your software reduces the risk of
vulnerabilities.
* *Risk Management*: SBOMs help identify, track, and remediate issues in
the software supply chain.
* *Compliance*: They demonstrate adherence to evolving cybersecurity and
data privacy laws.

*As cybersecurity frameworks continue to evolve, the use of SBOMs is increasingly seen as foundational for compliance and risk mitigation.*

==== Installing the Trusted Profile Analyzer 

* Log into your Bastion
+
[source]
----
 ssh lab-user@bastion.GUID.sandbox####.opentlc.com
----
* Install Homebrew
+
[source]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----
+
* Once installed, run the following commands to add Homebrew to your PATH: 
+
[source]
+
----
echo >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
----

* Install Homebrew's dependencies
+
[source]
+
----
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
----

* Now that Homebrew is installed, use it to install gcc
+
[source]
+
----
brew install gcc
----

* Once gcc is installed successfully with Homebrew, install Syft
+
[source]
----
brew install syft
----

==== Generating an SBOM

Now that we have Syft installed, we will pull an Openjdk11 image with flaws. 

*First, ensure the podman socket and API services are running
+
[source]
----
systemctl --user start podman.socket
systemctl --user enable podman.socket
----

*Using podman, pull the image
+
[source]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:1.20-2.1723644093
----

* Retag the image to more easily recognize it
+
[source]
----
podman tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:1.20-2.1723644093 openjdk11-bad:latest
----

* Use Syft to create an SBOM from a local image
+
[source]
----
syft openjdk-11-bad:latest -o spdx-json | jq . -r > openjdk-11-flawed.spdx
----
* You should get an output similar to the following: 
+
[source]
----

==== *Using the Trusted Profile Analyzer UI*

A Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer has been created for you to use. The proctor will make the URL available to you once you've completed the previous section. 

When you are given the URL, log into the RHTPA UI using the username and password provided.

image::lab1.1-tpa.png[]

You can search for an SBOM, advisory, or CVE directly from the home page, or you can click on Search in the left menu for further options. 

image::lab1.2-tpa.gif[]

From the Search page, you can choose to browse SBOMs, Packages, CVEs, and Advisories from the Tabs, and further filter using the filter menu on the left. 

Let's take a look at some packages. 

Click the Packages tab, then check the Red Hat box under supplier. 

The list now shows packages that are supplied by Red Hat. 

You may click on a package to get information like related vulnerabilities, if any exist, and related products. 

==== Uploading an SBOM

An SBOM has been made available for you to download https://github.com/SeanRickerd/sbom/blob/main/home-banking-bom.json[here].

Upload the SBOM. 

image::lab11.1-sbom.gif[]

It will take a few minutes for the SBOM to be processed by TPA, so click in the Search bar and type "home". Once you see home-banking, click on it. 

image::lab11.2-sbom.gif[] 

This will open the page for the home-banking SBOM you've uploaded. 

The Info tab will give you standard information about the SBOM itself, including the version, the CycloneDX version, and the serial number. 

Click on the Packages tab. 

image::lab11.3-sbom.png[]

The Packages tab will list all the packages found in this SBOM. 

Click on Dependency Analytics Report. 

The Dependency Analytics Report tab will list the security issues found in this SBOM. As you can see, there are a number of violations found. 3 of them are Critical, 3 High, and 2 Medium. 

Scroll down the page to find the osv tab. 

Here you will find further information about the detected vulnerabilities. Clicking on the Direct Vulnerabilities to the right of the log4j entry will expand the entry to show more information about he vulnerabilities, including Remediation. 

The same can be done with the Transitive Vulnerabilites next to the struts2-core entry.
