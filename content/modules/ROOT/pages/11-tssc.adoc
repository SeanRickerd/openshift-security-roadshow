== Module 11: Trusted Software Supply Chain

=== Goal of Module 11

The goal of this lab is to learn about the features from the Trusted Software Supply Chain suite of products from Red Hat. 


== Trusted Artifact Signer
Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer(TAS) enhances software supply chain security by simplifying cryptographic signing and verification of software artifacts, such as container images, binaries, and documents. 

Trusted Artifact Signer provides a production-ready deployment of the https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore project] as a core component of the Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain product family.

Signing and verification, e.g. using GPG has been around a long time - why would someone found a new Open Source project to address signing and verification, you might ask.

=== *Why Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer?*

. *Supply Chain Security*: Modern software development requires robust
mechanisms to secure dependencies and artifacts, which GPG struggles to
address effectively.
. *Usability*: Developers need simpler, more intuitive signing solutions
without the burden of manual key management.
. *Transparency*: A centralized, tamper-evident log system ensures
accountability and traceability of signatures, enhancing trust.
. *Modern Identity Integration*: Sigstore aligns with contemporary
authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect), making it
easier to tie signatures to identities.
. *Automation*: Sigstore fits seamlessly into automated CI/CD workflows,
which are critical in modern software development pipelines.


These are bold statements, so let's quickly compare the two to better understand the advantages that Trusted Artifact Signer brings to the table:

==== *1. Key Management*

* *GPG*:
** Users must generate and manage long-term public/private key pairs
themselves.
** Keys are often stored locally, and their security is tied to the
user’s system.
** If a private key is lost or compromised, recovery or revocation can
be complex.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Utilizes short-lived (ephemeral) keys generated on-demand for
signing.
** No need for long-term private key management; keys are automatically
discarded after use.
** Simplifies key management for developers, reducing the risk of key
compromise.

'''''

==== *2. Trust Model*

* *GPG*:
** Relies on a *Web of Trust* where individuals sign each other’s keys
to establish authenticity.
** Trust depends on manual verification and key-signing parties, which
can be cumbersome and error-prone.
** Requires a high degree of trust in individual users and their ability
to manage their keys properly.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication, binding artifacts
to an identity (e.g., an SSO system such as Keycloak, a GitHub or GitLab account, email, etc.).
** Trust is rooted in central transparency logs (e.g., Rekor), ensuring
all signatures are centrally (or publicly, if desired) auditable.
** Encourages a more automated and modern trust model, simplifying
verification.

'''''

==== *3. Transparency and Verifiability*

* *GPG*:
** Signed artifacts and their signatures must be manually shared and
verified.
** No central or automatic system for transparency or revocation
tracking.
** Difficult to audit or trace all signatures and the associated public
keys at scale.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Every signing action is logged in a central, optionally public, tamper-evident
transparency log (Rekor).
** Anyone can independently verify the signing event and its associated
identity.
** Provides a centralized and automated system for transparency and
auditability.

'''''

==== *4. Ease of Use*

* *GPG*:
** Comparatively complex for users, requiring manual key generation, management,
and sharing.
** CLI tools have a steep learning curve and are not always
user-friendly.
** Widespread adoption hindered by usability challenges.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Streamlined experience designed for developers and modern workflows.
** No need to manually manage keys or trust chains; authentication is
identity-based.
** Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines and modern development
practices.

'''''

==== *5. Security*

* *GPG*:
** Vulnerable to long-term key compromise if private keys are not
properly secured.
** Trust in signatures is tightly coupled to key security and revocation
is challenging.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Ephemeral keys reduce the risk of long-term compromise.
** Transparency logs provide tamper-evident evidence of signing,
reducing the risk of undetected forgery.
** Designed with supply chain security in mind, reducing risks from
malicious dependencies or compromised keys.

'''''

==== *Advantages of Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer over GPG*

In summary, Sigstore is designed to address the pain points and
limitations of GPG in the context of modern software development,
focusing on ease of use, transparency, and security for signing and
verifying software artifacts.

* Eliminates manual key management.
* Provides automated, identity-based signing.
* Ensures transparency with central (optionally public) logs.
* Simplifies adoption with developer-friendly tools.
* Reduces risks from long-term private key compromises.
* Aligns with modern software practices and supply chain security
requirements.


=== Setup 
For this exercise, we'll be using the container image in Quay that we created during our Lab setup xref:00-setup-install-navigation.adoc#build-a-container-image[Build a container image]

NOTE: Make sure you still have the variables set. If not, please go through the xref:00-setup-install-navigation.adoc#build-a-container-image[Build a container image] section again to setup your environment and make sure you have pushed the image to Quay.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
----

For signing and verification of container images, we'll be using the `cosign` CLI binary, which has already been installed in your bastion host (and can also be downloaded from the OpenShift Console).

`cosign` can as easily be used in any CI/CD toolchain as we use it here and handles all the communication with the Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer services that request certificates, handle the OIDC authentication, store info in the transparency log (Rekor), etc.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign version

GitVersion:    v2.0.0
GitCommit:     d6b9001f8e6ed745fb845849d623274c897d55f2
GitTreeState:  clean
BuildDate:     2023-02-23T19:26:35Z
GoVersion:     go1.20.1

Platform:      linux/amd64
----

`cosign` needs to be initialized with all the required endpoints that it communicates with. Additionally, during initialization, it will download the public trust root certificate in a local cache.

This initialization can be done via command line parameters or by setting environment variables that are read when no commandline parameters are present.

NOTE: Cosign itself doesn't need access to OpenShift, but since we have Trusted Artifact Signer installed on OpenShift (a RHEL installation is another deployment option), we will be using some `oc` commands to get the required endpoints.
Before proceeding, please verify you are still logged in to OpenShift via `oc whoami`

To setup the environment variables, execute this script:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export TUF_URL=$(oc get tuf -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://$(oc get route keycloak -n rhsso | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')/auth/realms/openshift
export COSIGN_FULCIO_URL=$(oc get fulcio -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export COSIGN_REKOR_URL=$(oc get rekor -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export COSIGN_MIRROR=$TUF_URL
export COSIGN_ROOT=$TUF_URL/root.json
export COSIGN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="trusted-artifact-signer"
export COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_CERTIFICATE_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_YES="true"
# to verify URL endpoints have been set
env | grep URL
----

As the last step, initialize `cosign`, so it knows who to talk to:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign initialize
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

=== Signing and verifying git commits





== Trusted Profile Analyzer 
The Trusted Profile Analyzer adds management capabilities for *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to OpenShift. 

=== *What is an SBOM?* 
https://www.cisa.gov[CISA.gov] defines an SBOM as "a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components." https://www.cisa.gov/sbom[¹] 

Using SBOMs, you can have a clear vision of everything that goes into your application or what you may have received from vendors, such as Red Hat. This enables platform engineers to more easily enforce operational controls and compliance across hybrid multi-cloud environments. 

In addition, several regulatory requirements and frameworks either *mandate* or *recommend* the use of *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to enhance software supply chain transparency and security. Here are some key examples, but the list is continually growing:


==== *1. U.S. Executive Order 14028 (Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity)*

* *Mandate*: In May 2021, this Executive Order directed the U.S.
government to take actions to secure the software supply chain.
* *SBOM Requirement*:
** The *National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA)* was tasked with defining minimum elements for SBOMs.
** Vendors providing software to federal agencies must provide SBOMs as
part of their cybersecurity practices.
** Goal: Increase transparency about software components to mitigate
risks from vulnerabilities.



==== *2. EU Cyber Resilience Act*

* *Proposed Mandate*: Expected to become law in the near future, this
act will apply to products with digital elements in the EU.
* *SBOM Requirement*: It encourages or requires organizations to
maintain transparency about their software dependencies, including
SBOMs, for compliance with security standards.



==== *3. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance*

* *Recommendation*: The FDA issued guidance for medical device
manufacturers to include SBOMs.
* *Context*: As part of the *Pre-market Cybersecurity Guidance* for
medical devices, manufacturers are encouraged to provide SBOMs to
identify vulnerabilities in device software and support risk management.
* *Goal*: Protect healthcare systems and patient safety.


==== *4. OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS)*

* *Recommendation*: OWASP promotes SBOMs as part of software composition
analysis (SCA) to track components and identify vulnerabilities.
* *Context*: Although not a regulatory requirement, it is widely
recognized in cybersecurity best practices.



==== *5. CISA Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 23-01*

* *Mandate*: U.S. government agencies are required to track and mitigate
known vulnerabilities in software they use.
* *SBOM Role*: Although the directive doesn’t explicitly mandate SBOMs,
managing them is critical to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
efficiently.



==== *6. ISO/IEC 5962 (SBOM Standard)*

* *Recommendation*: This international standard formalizes SBOM
structure, ensuring consistent implementation across industries. It
supports compliance with regulatory and industry standards requiring
software transparency.



==== *7. Proposed SEC Cybersecurity Rules*

* *Recommendation*: Companies under U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) regulations must report cybersecurity risks, including
supply chain vulnerabilities. SBOMs can help meet these transparency
requirements.



=== *Why SBOMs are Becoming Standard in Regulations*

* *Transparency*: Knowing what’s in your software reduces the risk of
vulnerabilities.
* *Risk Management*: SBOMs help identify, track, and remediate issues in
the software supply chain.
* *Compliance*: They demonstrate adherence to evolving cybersecurity and
data privacy laws.

*As cybersecurity frameworks continue to evolve, the use of SBOMs is increasingly seen as foundational for compliance and risk mitigation.*
