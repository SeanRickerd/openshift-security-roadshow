== Module 11: Trusted Software Supply Chain

=== Goal of Module 11

The goal of this lab is to learn about the features from the Trusted Software Supply Chain suite of products from Red Hat. 


=== Trusted Artifact Signer
Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer(TAS) enhances software supply chain security by simplifying cryptographic signing and verification of software artifacts, such as container images, binaries, and documents. Trusted Artifact Signer provides a production-ready deployment of the Sigstore project in Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain.



=== Trusted Profile Analyzer 
The Trusted Profile Analyzer (based on Syft) brings Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to OpenShift. What is an SBOM? https://www.cisa.gov[CISA.gov] defines an SBOM as "a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components." https://www.cisa.gov/sbom[¹] 

Using SBOMs, you can have a clear vision of everything that goes into your application. This enables platform engineers to more easily enforce operational controls and compliance across hybrid multi-cloud environments.

==== Installing the Trusted Profile Analyzer 

* Log into your Bastion
+
[source]
----
 ssh lab-user@bastion.GUID.sandbox####.opentlc.com
----
* Install Homebrew
+
[source]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----
+
* Once installed, run the following commands to add Homebrew to your PATH: 
+
[source]
+
----
echo >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
----

* Install Homebrew's dependencies
+
[source]
+
----
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
----

* Now that Homebrew is installed, use it to install gcc
+
[source]
+
----
brew install gcc
----

* Once gcc is installed successfully with Homebrew, install Syft
+
[source]
----
brew install syft
----

==== Generating an SBOM

Now that we have Syft installed, we will pull an Openjdk11 image with flaws. 

*First, ensure the podman socket and API services are running
+
[source]
----
systemctl --user start podman.socket
systemctl --user enable podman.socket
----

*Using podman, pull the image
+
[source]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:1.20-2.1723644093
----

* Retag the image to more easily recognize it
+
[source]
----
podman tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:1.20-2.1723644093 openjdk11-bad:latest
----

* Use Syft to create an SBOM from a local image
+
[source]
----
syft openjdk-11-bad:latest -o spdx-json | jq . -r > openjdk-11-flawed.spdx
----
* You should get an output similar to the following: 
+
[source]
----
 ✔ Loaded image                                                                                                                                                        localhost/openjdk11-bad:latest

* You can have a closer look at the contents of the SBOM by using the following command:

==== Using the Trusted Profile Analyzer UI

A Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer has been created for you to use. The proctor will make the URL available to you once you've completed the previous section. 

When you are given the URL, log into the RHTPA UI using the username and password provided.

image::lab1.1-tpa.png[]

You can search for an SBOM, advisory, or CVE directly from the home page, or you can click on Search in the left menu for further options. 

image::lab1.2-tpa.gif[]

From the Search page, you can choose to browse SBOMs, Packages, CVEs, and Advisories from the Tabs, and further filter using the filter menu on the left. 

Let's take a look at some packages. 

Click the Packages tab, then check the Red Hat box under supplier. 

The list now shows packages that are supplied by Red Hat. 

You may click on a package to get information like related vulnerabilities, if any exist, and related products. 

==== Uploading an SBOM

An SBOM has been made available for you to download https://github.com/SeanRickerd/sbom/blob/main/home-banking-bom.json[here].

Upload the SBOM. 

image::lab11.1-sbom.gif[]

It will take a few minutes for the SBOM to be processed by TPA, so click in the Search bar and type "home". Once you see home-banking, click on it. 

image::lab11.2-sbom.gif[] 

This will open the page for the home-banking SBOM you've uploaded. 

The Info tab will give you standard information about the SBOM itself, including the version, the CycloneDX version, and the serial number. 

Click on the Packages tab. 

image::lab11.3-sbom.png[]

The Packages tab will list all the packages found in this SBOM. 

Click on Dependency Analytics Report. 

The Dependency Analytics Report tab will list the security issues found in this SBOM. As you can see, there are a number of violations found. 3 of them are Critical, 3 High, and 2 Medium. 

Scroll down the page to find the osv tab. 

Here you will find further information about the detected vulnerabilities. Clicking on the Direct Vulnerabilities to the right of the log4j entry will expand the entry to show more information about he vulnerabilities, including Remediation. 

The same can be done with the Transitive Vulnerabilites next to the struts2-core entry.
