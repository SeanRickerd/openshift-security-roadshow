= Capture the Flag

== Module goals
.Goals
* A CTF challenge: Web hacking a running container on OpenShift
* There are three flags found during the journey.

== Getting access

Start by networking the running container so that you can access it. the following commands deployes our vulnerable container to EKS and creates a LoadBalancer service to make it publically accessable. 

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc config use-context eks-admin
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ctf-web-to-system/ctf-w2s.yml
oc get svc ctf-web-to-system-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
----

*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
Switched to context "eks-admin".
service/ctf-web-to-system-service unchanged
deployment.apps/ctf-web-to-system configured
acd92c6dbdc764acba141ee700c02bc7-1182151901.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
----

IMPORTANT: Use the amazonaws.com link to access the vulnerable container

== Monitor progress in RHACS

As you run you commands, make sure to check RHACS to see what it will flag.
