==  Black Hat - RHACS Log4Shell Vulnerability Demonstration 

In this lab, you demonstrate how to quickly stop workloads with `log4shell` vulnerabilities from deploying using Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS). You also learn how to locate workloads with `log4shell`.

.Goals
* Prevent the execution of vulnerable deployments
* Report and resolve the violation

== Ensure a clean environment

. Start by ensuring you have a clean lab environment. Run the following command to reset any changes others may have made.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc delete project log4shell
rm ~/deploy.yaml
----

== Deploy the log4shell infected container image

The next step is to deploy the log4shell laden container image to the OpenShift cluster. 

. Procedure
. Start by creating a new project and deploying a vulnerable Log4Shell application. 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc new-project log4shell
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Now using project "log4shell" on server "https://api.cluster-fdg9s.fdg9s.sandbox674.opentlc.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
----

[start=2]
. Next, deploy the vulnerable application by creating and applying the following deployment YAML file:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat << EOF >deploy.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: log4shell
  namespace: log4shell
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      deployment: log4shell
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        deployment: log4shell
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: log4shell
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
        terminationMessagePolicy: File
      restartPolicy: Always
EOF
----

[start=3]
. Deploy the log4shell deployment into your new projecct by using the 'oc' CLI

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f ./deploy.yaml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ oc create -f ./deploy.yaml
deployment.apps/log4shell created
----

[start=4]
. Ensure that the application was deployed without issues. 

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -l deployment=log4shell -A
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ oc get pods -l deployment=log4shell -A
NAMESPACE   NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
log4shell   log4shell-5d4b665947-grp8d   1/1     Running   0          63s
----

IMPORTANT: For the last part of this section, check to make sure that the log4shell vulnerability is in the container with a quick CLI scan using the roxctl CLI

[start=5]
. Execute the following command in the terminal to ensure the log4shell vulnerability is present.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0 --force -o table --severity=CRITICAL
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
misc/log4shell:1.0 --force -o table --severity=CRITICAL
Scan results for image: quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0
(TOTAL-COMPONENTS: 4, TOTAL-VULNERABILITIES: 3, LOW: 0, MODERATE: 0, IMPORTANT: 0, CRITICAL: 3)

== Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) web console 

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes is a Kubernetes-native security platform that equips you to build, deploy, and run cloud-native applications with more security. The solution helps protect containerized Kubernetes workloads in all major clouds and hybrid platforms, including Red Hat OpenShift, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

=== Access the RHACS web console.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Log into the RHACS console at `{acs_route}`
. Click the "Advanced" button in your browser

=== Find the log4shell vulnerability in RHACS dashboard. 

The next step is to use the ACS dashboard to locate the Log4shell vulnerability. The following gif will showcase how to locate the vulnerability witht the exact steps outlines below. 

NOTE: CVE-2021-44228 & CVE-2021-45046 can both be used to find the log4shell vulnerabiulity in the dashboard.

. Procedure

=== Set Deploy Time Enforcement to On

You must enable deploy-time enforcement for the `Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability` policy.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Platform Configuration -> Policy Management* and find the policy called `Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability`.
+
TIP: To find the policy quickly, type `Policy` followed by `Log4Shell` into the filter bar on the *Policy Management* page.

. Select the policy by clicking the three dots to the right and select `Edit policy`.


. Use the `Policy Behavior` tab and enable runtime enforcement by clicking the `inform and enforce button` under `Response Method`
. Scroll down to `Configure enforcement behavior` and switch both the `Enforce on Build` and `Enforce on Deploy` selectors to on. 


. Click *Review Policy* on the left and *Save*.

image::../assets/images/policy-1.gif[]

+
. Redeploy the vulnerable image
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f ./deploy.yaml
----
+
. Examine the output and note that the Deployment failed to start:

----
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): error when creating "./deploy.yaml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request:
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability
- Description:
    ↳ Alert on deployments with images containing the Log4Shell vulnerabilities
      (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046). There are flaws in the Java logging library
      Apache Log4j in versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding 2.12.2.
- Rationale:
    ↳ These vulnerabilities allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if
      the system logs an attacker-controlled string value with the attacker's JNDI
      LDAP server lookup.
- Remediation:
    ↳ Update the log4j libary to version 2.16.0 (for Java 8 or later), 2.12.2 (for
      Java 7) or later. If not possible to upgrade, then remove the JndiLookup class
      from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar
      org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
- Violations:
    - CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS 10) (severity Critical) found in component 'log4j' (version 2.14.1) in container 'log4shell'
    - CVE-2021-45046 (CVSS 9) (severity Critical) found in component 'log4j' (version 2.14.1) in container 'log4shell'


In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
You might get a different message, detailed below.
RHACS has not yet scanned the image, and is blocking unscanned images from deployment.
If that is the case, simpley run the `oc create -f ./deploy.yaml` again and it will have scanned the image.
Now the deployment will trigger the log4j violations above.
----
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): error when creating "./deploy.yaml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request:
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Images with no scans
- Description:
    ↳ Alert on deployments with images that have not been scanned
- Rationale:
    ↳ Without a scan, there will be no vulnerability information for this image
- Remediation:
    ↳ Configure the appropriate registry and scanner integrations so that StackRox can
      obtain scans for your images.
- Violations:
    - Image in container 'log4shell' has not been scanned


In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number

.Procedure
. Navigate to the *Violation* page from the left navigation bar.
. Use the Filter Bar to find the `Policy: Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability` and select the policy name.
. Explore the list of the violation events.

== Summary

You enabled Log4Shell deploy-time policy enforcement, and verified that the policy prevented the `log4shell` container from running.
