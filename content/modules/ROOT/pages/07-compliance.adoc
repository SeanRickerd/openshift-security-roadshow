== Compliance Operator and Compliance in ACS

The OpenShift Compliance Operator allows OpenShift Container Platform administrators to define the desired compliance state of a cluster and provides an overview of gaps and ways to remediate any non-compliant policy.

The OpenShift Compliance Operator assesses both Kubernetes API resources and OpenShift Container Platform resources, as well as the nodes running the cluster. The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies provided by the content.

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) supports OpenShift Container Platform configuration compliance standards through an integration with the OpenShift Container Platform Compliance Operator. In addition, it allows you to measure and report on configuration security best practices for OpenShift Container Platform.

== Install the Compliance Operator

.Procedure
. Log into the OCP console at `{web_console_url}`
. Click the *rhsso* option
. Enter the OCP credentials

== Configuring the ScanSettingBinding object

Now, before the compliance 2.0 dashboard and ACS users would have had to set up a ScanSettingBinding object to schedule their compliance operator schedules this can be done in RHACS.

But you still have to set your compliance profiles. 

== Configuring the Compliance Operator ProfileBundles

The `ProfileBundle` object requires two pieces of information: the URL of a container image that contains the contentImage and the file that contains the compliance content. The contentFile parameter is relative to the root of the file system. You can define the built-in `rhcos4` `ProfileBundle` object as shown in the following example:

```YAML
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProfileBundle
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-10-19T12:06:30Z"
  finalizers:
  - profilebundle.finalizers.compliance.openshift.io
  generation: 1
  name: rhcos4
  namespace: openshift-compliance
  resourceVersion: "46741"
  uid: 22350850-af4a-4f5c-9a42-5e7b68b82d7d
spec:
  contentFile: ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml 
  contentImage: registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:900e... 
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-19T12:07:51Z"
    message: Profile bundle successfully parsed
    reason: Valid
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  dataStreamStatus: VALID
```

Let's ;look at the default ProfileBundles in OpenShift

.Procedure
. Run till following command to restart the RHACS scanner pod. This will speed up the process for the profiles to appear in RHACS Central.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=sensor -n stackrox
----

[start=2]
. Next run an "oc" command to look at the default ProfileBundles.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc get -n openshift-compliance profilebundle.compliance
----

*Sample Output*

[source,sh]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ oc get -n openshift-compliance profilebundle.compliance
NAME     CONTENTIMAGE                                                                                                                               CONTENTFILE         STATUS
ocp4     registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:dee91b7c0551a01fe2a3e6fcf3788e76f3ab5be8daa5ca59709840af6592203a   ssg-ocp4-ds.xml     VALID
rhcos4   registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:dee91b7c0551a01fe2a3e6fcf3788e76f3ab5be8daa5ca59709840af6592203a   ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml   VALID
----

So we have profiles. Now it's time to create a scan. 

== Execute the first Compliance Scan

When installing RHACS you need to kick off a complaince scan to ensure that the Compliance results are available. So let’s execute our first compliance scan.

.Procedure
. Head to the Compliance 1.0 dashboard
. Click the "Scan environment" button on the top left.

image::07-comp-3.png[OpenShift console]

[start=3]

Wait a few seconds and your dashboard should populate.

== Review the Compliance Reports in the Compliance Dashboard

The compliance reports gather information for configuration, industry standards, and best practices for container-based workloads running in Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Each standard represents a series of controls, with guidance provided by RHACS on the specific OpenShift configuration or DevOps process required to meet that control.

*Let's review the dashboard.*

In the top right of the dashboard you will see two of the dropdown options
 
image::07-comp-6.png[OpenShift console]

* Manage standards &
* Export

*Click the "Manage standards button"*

image::07-comp-6.png[OpenShift console]

You will see all of the standards available to you in the dashboard. These standards will effect ALL of the controls that you see in the dashboad. For example;

*Remove all of the options except NIST SP 800-53.*

image::07-comp-8.png[OpenShift console]

And you should end up with a dashboard that looks like this

image::07-comp-9.png[OpenShift console]

*Click the "Manage standards button"*

. Click on PCI, or the PCI percentage bar, in the upper-left “Passing Standards Across Clusters” graph

image::07-comp-4.png[OpenShift console]

[start=2]
. Click on Control 1.1.4, “Requirements for a firewall…”

image::07-comp-5.png[OpenShift console]

For example, PCI-DSS has controls that refer to firewalls and DMZ - not exactly cloud-native

In OpenShift, that requirement, and other isolation requirements, is met by Network Policies, and the 4% compliance score here indicates that very few deployments have correctly defined policies.

=== Evidence Export
Last thing about compliance - you’re only as compliant as you can prove!

. Click on the Export button in the upper right to show the “Evidence as CSV” option

This is the evidence export that your auditors will want to see for proof that the security controls mandated are actually in place.

|====
How would you bring this standard up to 100%?
|====

== Managing the compliance 2.0 feature (Technology Preview)

You can view the compliance results associated with your cluster by using the compliance 2.0 feature in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) portal. The feature collects compliance information gathered by the Compliance Operator into a single interface.

Currently, the compliance 2.0 feature and the Compliance Operator evaluate only infrastructure and platform compliance.

=== Viewing the cluster compliance page

By viewing the cluster compliance page, you can get a comprehensive overview of the compliance status of your clusters.

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the Compliance (2.0) → Cluster Compliance → Coverage tab.

image::07-comp-10.png[OpenShift console]

The cluster compliance page organizes information in the following groups:

*1. Cluster:* Gives the details of your cluster and provides a snapshot of its current state and configurations.

*2. Operator status:* Assesses the health and operational status of the Compliance Operator instance within your cluster and ensures that the Operator is running optimally and functioning seamlessly.

*3. Compliance:* Shows the percentage of checks that have been passed for the scanned profiles.

image::07-comp-11.png[OpenShift console]

=== Creating a compliance scan schedule

By creating a compliance scan schedule, you can customize and automate your compliance scans to align with your operational requirements.

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the Compliance (2.0) → Cluster Compliance → Schedules tab.
. Click Create scan schedule.

In the Configuration options page, provide the following information:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name: | Enter a name to identify different compliance scans.
| Description: | Specify the reason for each compliance scan.
| Configure schedule: | Adjust the scan schedule to fit your required schedule:
| Frequency: | From the drop-down list, select how often you want to perform the scan. Frequencies include Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.
| On day(s): | From the list, select one or more days of the week on which you want to perform the scan. Valid values include Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, The first of the month, and The middle of the month.
*These values are only applicable if you specify the frequency of scan as Weekly or Monthly.*
| Time: | Start to type the time in hh:mm at which you want to run the scan. From the list that is displayed, select a time.
|===

[start=3]
. Click Next.

. In the Clusters page, select one or more clusters that you want to include in the scan.

image::07-comp-12.png[OpenShift console]

[start=5]
. Click *Next*.
. In the Profiles page, select one or more profiles that you want to include in the scan.
. Click *Next*.
. Review your scan configuration, and then click Create.

=== Verification

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the Compliance (2.0) → Cluster Compliance → Schedules tab.
. Select the compliance scan you have created.

In the Clusters section, verify that the operator status is healthy.

Optional: To edit the scan schedule, click Edit scan schedule, make your changes, and then click Save.

Viewing the compliance scan status
By viewing the status of a compliance scan, you can efficiently monitor and analyze the health of your clusters.

Wait until the Compliance Operator returns the scan results. It might take a few minutes.

. Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the Compliance (2.0) → Cluster Compliance → Coverage tab.

Select a cluster to view the details of the individual scans.

OPTIONAL: Enter the name of the compliance check in the Filter by keyword box to view the status.

OPTIONAL: From the Compliance status drop-down list, select one or more statuses by using which you want to filter the scan details. Compliance statuses include Pass, Fail, Error, Info, Manual, Not Applicable, and Inconsistent.

== Compliance scan status overview

By understanding the compliance scan status, you can manage the overall security posture of your environment.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
Status |	Description

|Fail 
|The compliance check failed.

| Pass 
| The compliance check passed.
| Not Applicable 
| Skipped the compliance check because it was not applicable.
| Info 
| The compliance check gathered data, but RHACS could not make a pass or fail determination.
| Error 
| The compliance check failed due to a technical issue.
| Manual 
| Manual intervention is required to ensure compliance.
| Inconsistent 
| The compliance scan data is inconsistent, and requires closer inspection and targeted resolution.

oc get pod -n openshift-compliance


Running compliance scans

We now want to make sure that the nodes are scanned appropiately. For this, we’ll need a ScanSettingsBinding, this bind a profile with scan settings in order to get scans to run.

Create a ScanSettingBinding object that binds to the default ScanSetting object and scans the cluster using the cis and cis-node profiles.


oc apply -f co-scan.yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSettingBinding
metadata:
  name: cis-scan
  namespace: openshift-compliance
profiles:
- apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Profile
  name: ocp4-cis
settingsRef:
  apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ScanSetting
  name: default
Check the scansettingbinding generated:


oc get scansettingbinding cis-scan -n openshift-compliance -o yaml
With this the scan will start as you can check with the CRD of ComplianceScan.


oc get compliancescan -n openshift-compliance ocp4-cis
 oc get compliancescan -n openshift-compliance
NAME       PHASE     RESULT
ocp4-cis   RUNNING   NOT-AVAILABLE
After the scan is done, you’ll see it was persistent in the relevant namespace:


oc get compliancescan -n openshift-compliance
NAME       PHASE   RESULT
ocp4-cis   DONE    NON-COMPLIANT
Review Compliance Scans of the Compliance Operator in RHACS
After completing the previous steps, you will be able to find the results from the Compliance Operator compliance reports in RHACS.

If RHACS was installed prior to the Compliance Operator, we’ll need to restart the ACS sensor in the OpenShift cluster to see these results.


oc delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=sensor -n stackrox
With the Sensor restarted, kick off a compliance scan in ACS to see the updated results:

ACS 4
In the ACS User Interface, select Compliance from the left menu, and click Scan Environment in the top menu bar. The scan should only take a few seconds; once it’s complete you should see entries for both the ACS built-in and compliance operator standards:

Check that the ocp4-cis report from the Compliance Operator is shown in ACS Compliance Dashboard:

ACS 5
To see the detailed results, click on the name or bar of any of the standards. To investigate the results of the OpenShift CIS benchmark scan, for example, click ocp4-cis:

ACS 6
For more information check the Compliance Operator guide

Configure Policy in RHACS to Invoke Compliance related Controls
The Built-in standards in RHACS Compliance provide guidance on required configurations to meet each individual control. Standards like PCI, HIPAA, and NIST 800-190 are focused on workloads visible to RHACS, and apply to all workloads running in any Kubernetes cluster that RHACS is installed in.

Much of the control guidance can be implemented using RHACS policies, and providing appropriate policy with enforcement in RHACS can change compliance scores.

As an example, we’ll look at a control in the NIST 800-190 that requires that container images be kept up to date, and to use meaningful version tags: "practices should emphasize accessing images using immutable names that specify discrete versions of images to be used."

This configuration will change the behavior of your Kubernetes clusters and possibly result in preventing new deployments from being created. After testing, you can quickly revert the changes using the instructions at the end of this section.
Inspect the NIST 800-190 Guidance for Control 4.2.2

Navigate back to the RHACS Compliance page.

In the section labeled "PASSING STANDARDS ACROSS CLUSTERS", click on NIST 800-190.

Scroll down to control 4.2.2 and examine the control guidance on the right.

The control guidance reads: "StackRox continuously monitors the images being used by active deployments. StackRox provides built-in policies that detects if images with insecure tags are being used or if the image being used is pretty old. Therefore, the cluster is compliant if there are policies that are being enforced that discourages such images from being deployed."

RHACS 7
Enforce Policies that Meet Guidance for NIST Control 4.2.2
There are two separate default system policies that, together, meet this control’s guidance, "90-day Image Age," and "Latest tag". Both must have enforcement enabled for this control to be satisfied.

Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management

Find and click on the policy named, "90-day Image Age" which by default is second in the list. We’re not going to change this policy other than to enable enforcement.

Click Actions → Edit Policy to get to the Policy settings.

Click Next at the bottom panel to get to the Policy Behavior page.

On the response method options, click Inform and Enforce.

Click on for both Build and Deploy enforcement.

Click Next at the bottom panel until you get to Review Policy page.

Click Save.

At the main Policy Management page, find the Policy named, "Latest tag" and repeat steps 3 - 8 to enable enforcement and save the policy.

RHACS 8
View Updated Compliance Scan Results in RHACS
In order to see the impact on NIST 800-190 scores:

Navigate back to the compliance page.

Click "Scan Environment" in the upper right.

In the section labeled "PASSING STANDARDS ACROSS CLUSTERS", click on NIST 800-190.

Scroll down to control 4.2.2 and verify that the control now reports 100% compliance.

RHACS 9
Revert the Policy Changes
To avoid rejecting any other deployments to the cluster, you should disable the enforcement after viewing the updated RHACS results.

Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management Find and click on the policy named, "90-day Image Age" which by default is second in the list. Click Edit to get to the Policy settings.

Click Actions → Edit Policy to get to the Policy settings.

Click Next at the bottom panel to get to the Policy Behavior page.

On the response method options, click Inform.

Click Next at the bottom panel until you get to Review Policy page.

Click Save.

At the main Policy Management page, find the Policy named, "Latest tag" and repeat the steps to disable enforcement and save the policy.
