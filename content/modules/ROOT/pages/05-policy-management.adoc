= Policy Management

== Module goals
* Create build, deploy and runtime policies 
* Create policies from filters
* Clone and edit policies based on the ACS defaults

== RHACS Policy Management Basics

RHACS has many built-in policies to detect activity related to attacker goals: gain a foothold, maintain a presence, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. The continuous runtime monitoring observes all container activity and will automatically respond to events with appropriate enforcement and notification. However, that would be missing out on an opportunity - RHACS wants to go one step further, to take advantage of containers' ephemeral, immutable nature, to improve security in a measurable way from now on.

We want to use runtime incidents and vulnerabilities as a learning opportunity to improve security going forward by constraining how our containers can act. We achieve this by creating policies and implementing them early in the CI/CD process.

As we move into this next section, let's focus on identifying and enforcing a runtime policy in the cluster. For the upcoming example, we will focus on stopping the Ubuntu package manager from being run on pods in our cluster. Our example container *ctf-web-to-system* has this package manager in the container. Let's ensure that it never calls for updates while present in our clusters.

=== Create Policies

You can create new security policies based on the filtering criteria that you select.

RHACS transforms the filtering criteria into policy criteria by converting the cluster, namespace, and deployment filters to equivalent policy scopes.

To create a policy, you use the same filter to see which deployments have run `bash` that you used previously.

image::images/02_vuln_13.png[policy creation]

However, when you create new security policies from the *Risk* view based on the selected filtering criteria, not all requirements are directly applied to the new policy.
You must fill out some additional information.

.Procedure
. Click the *+ (Create Policy)* next to the filter bar and complete the required fields to create a new policy:
* *Name*: `No bash allowed`
* *Severity*: `High`
* *Categories*: `Anomalous Activity`
* *Description*: `No bash allowed`
* *Rationale*: `Too many known vulns`
* *Guidance*: `Use ZSH`
* *MITRE ATT&CK*: `The policy can be mapped to a MITRE ATT&CK technique.`
* *Lifecycle stages*: `Runtime`
* *Event sources*; `Deployment`
* *Response method*: `Inform`
* *Inform and enforce*: `Enform on Runtime`

* *Policy Crieria*: `On the right there is a *drag out policy fields* bar.Find *Process Activity* and select *Unexpected process executed*. Drag into into the policy section.`

Make sure to preview the policy before accepting it. 

== RHACS Runtime Policy Basics

RHACS observes container processes and collects this information to enable you to craft policies to prevent behavior that you don’t like. This information can also create baseline policy configurations that the user can update. Runtime policies can include all build-time and deploy-time policy criteria but they can also include data about process executions during runtime.

The example below demonstrates how security may want to block a package manager from downloading any packages to the container. This runtime enforcement option is the first in the process of shifting left. After runtime enforcement, you will want to stop the package manager from being used in the container altogether.

IMPORTANT: For the Runtime stage, RHACS stops all pods that match the conditions of the policy. It does not, scale the deployment down to zero.

*Procedure*

. On the left-hand side of the application, click the *Platform Configuration* tab and select *Policy Management*.

image::acs-policy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Dashboard]

[start=2]

. Filter through the policies to find *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* or use the search bar to select *Policy*.

image::acs-policy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Search]

[start=3]

. Once you have found the policy *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution*, click on it to learn more.

image::acs-policy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Details]

NOTE: If you click the actions button, you will see how easy it is to edit, clone, export or disable these policies. We also recommended cloning the policies and adding or removing specific filters as you need them.

[[runtime-enforce]]

=== Prevent execution of package manager binary

Package managers like apt (Ubuntu), apk (Alpine), or yum/dnf (RedHat) are binary software components used to manage and update installed software on a Linux® host system. They are used extensively to manage running virtual machines. However, using a package manager to install or remove software on a running container violates the immutable principle of container operation.

This policy demonstrates how RHACS detects and avoids a runtime violation, using Linux kernel instrumentation to detect the running process and OpenShift® to terminate the pod for enforcement. Using OpenShift to enforce runtime policy is preferable to enforcing rules directly within containers or in the container engine, as it avoids a disconnect between the state that OpenShift is maintaining and the state where the container is operating. Furthermore, because a runtime policy may detect only part of an attacker’s activity inside a container, removing the container avoids the attack.

=== Enable enforcement of policy

[start=3]

. Click the *Actions* button, then click *Edit policy*.

image::acs-runtime-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Select the *Policy Behavior* tab by hitting next or clicking the tab.

image::acs-runtime-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]

. Enable runtime enforcement by clicking the *inform and enforce* button.
. Configure enforcement behavior by selecting *Enforce at Runtime*.

image::acs-runtime-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Enforce Runtime Policy]

[start=8]

. Go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes
. Click save

IMPORTANT: Make sure to save the policy changes! If you do not save the policy, the process will not be blocked!

=== Testing the configured policy

Next, we will use tmux to watch OpenShift events while running the test so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you are signed into the bastion host with OpenShift access when running the following commands. 

[start=1]
. On your Bastion VM, ssh over to the *Bastion* host, and start tmux with two panes:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; attach
----

[start=2]

. Next, run a watch on OpenShift events in the first shell pane:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get events -w
----

[start=3]

. Press *Ctrl+b THEN o* to switch to the next pane. (Ctrl+b THEN o)
. Exec into our Java application by getting the pod details and adding them to the following command.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
POD=$(oc get pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
oc exec $POD -i --tty -- /bin/bash
----

*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ POD=$(oc get pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
oc exec $POD -i --tty -- /bin/bash
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-hz6j2:/app$
----

NOTE: If you see *node@ctf...* you've confirmed you have a shell and access to the Java application.

[start=5]
. Run the Ubuntu package manager in this shell:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
apt update
----

. Examine the output and expect to see that the package manager attempts to perform an update operation:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-stwhq:/$ apt update
Reading package lists... Done
E: List directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial is missing. - Acquire (13: Permission denied)
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-stwhq:/$ command terminated with exit code 137
----

. Examine the oc get events tmux pane (The pane on the bottom), and note that it shows that RHACS detected the package manager invocation and deleted the pod:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----

----

NOTE: After a few seconds, you can see the pod is deleted and recreated. In your tmux shell pane, note that your shell session has terminated and that you are returned to the Bastion VM command line.

Congrats! You have successfully stopped yourself from downloading malicious packages! However, the security investigative process continues, as you have now raised a flag that must be triaged! We will triage our violations later in this module.

NOTE: type exit in the terminal, use *ctrl+c* to stop the 'watch' command, and type exit one more time to get back to the default terminal.

CONTENT -> Worth talking about the differences in enforcement?

You can use admission controller enforcement for:

- Options in the pod securityContext.
- Deployment configurations.
- Image components and vulnerabilities.

You cannot use admission controller enforcement for:

- Any runtime behavior, such as processes.
- Any policies based on port exposure.

[[deploy-enforce]]

== Introduction to deploy-time policy enforcement

Deploy-time policy refers to enforcing configuration controls in the cluster and before deployment in the CI/CD process and the configuration of applications inside the cluster. Deploy-time policies can include all build-time policy criteria but they can also include data from your cluster configurations, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker socket.

There are two approaches to enforcing deploy-time policies in RHACS:

- In clusters with **listen** and **enforce** AdmissionController options enabled, RHACS uses the admission controller to reject deployments that violate policy.
- In clusters where the admission controller option is disabled, RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.

In the next example, we are going to configure a *Deploy-Time* policy to block applications from deploying into the default namespace with the *apt|dpkg* application in the image.

== Prevent the Ubuntu Package Manager in the ctf-web-to-system image from being deployed

. Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy* then *Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.

NOTE: This time we are going to edit a different policy. Specifically related to the *Build & Deploy* phases.

[start=3]

. Click on the *Ubuntu Package Manager in Image* options (The three dots on the right side of the screen) and select *Clone policy*

IMPORTANT: Make sure to *CLONE* the policy

image::acs-deploy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]

. Give the policy a new name. Something you will remember. The best practice would be to add a description for future policy enforcers as well. For example;

image::acs-deploy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Next, update the policy to *inform and enforce* while clicking on the deploy stage only.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to unselect the *Build* lifecycle before moving forward.

image::acs-deploy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]

Now, we want to target our specific deployment with an image label.

. Click on the *Policy criteria* tab.
. Click on the *Deployment metadata* dropdown on the right side of the browser.
. Find the *Namespace* label and drag it to the default policy criteria.
. Type *default* under the namespace criteria

Your policy should look like this,

image::acs-deploy-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=10]

. Lastly, go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes

NOTE: There is a preview tab on the right side of the page that will show you all of the affected applications with the introduction of this policy.

image::acs-deploy-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=12]

. Click Save

Now let's test it out! We're going to deploy a simple Ubuntu application to the cluster.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF > ubuntu-deployment.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:

        image: ubuntu:latest
        command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "--"]
        args: ["while true; do echo hello world; sleep 10; done"]
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
EOF
----

. Next apply the deployment manifest

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f ubuntu-deployment.yml
----

*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ oc apply -f ubuntu-deployment.yml 
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): error when creating "ubuntu-deployment.yml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request: 
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Ubuntu Package Manager in Image - Deploy
- Description:
    ↳ Alert on deployments with components of the Debian/Ubuntu package management
      system in the image.
- Rationale:
    ↳ Package managers make it easier for attackers to use compromised containers,
      since they can easily add software.
- Remediation:
    ↳ Run `dpkg -r --force-all apt apt-get && dpkg -r --force-all debconf dpkg` in the
      image build for production containers.
- Violations:
    - Container 'ubuntu' includes component 'apt' (version 2.7.14build2)
    - Container 'ubuntu' includes component 'dpkg' (version 1.22.6ubuntu6)

In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
----

Another option for enforcement is to use the "deployment check" CLI command.

*Procedure*

. Set variables to connect to RHACS Central.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS={acs_route}
cd ~/
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
----

[start=2]

. Verify the ctf-web-to-system application against the policies you've created.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl -e $ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443 deployment check --file $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ctf-web-to-system/ctf-w2s.yml --insecure-skip-tls-verify

You should see one of the policies you've create breaking the deploy process while the others are in inform only mode. 


Congrats! You're now enforcing against the Ubuntu package manager at runtime and deploy time. Let's finish with enforcing at build-time!

== Introduction to build-time policy enforcement (In progress)

Build time policies for container images are guidelines that define how container images should be constructed. These policies aim to achieve several goals, including:

- Security: Minimizing vulnerabilities and ensuring images are built with secure practices.
- Efficiency: Reducing image size and build times for faster deployments.
- Consistency: Maintaining a uniform structure and content across all images.
Here are some key areas covered by build time policies:

- Base Image: Specifying a minimal base image that only contains essential components.
- Package Management: Encouraging the use of package managers for dependency installation and updates.
- File Copying: Limiting what gets copied into the image to only required files and avoiding unnecessary bloat.
- User Management: Defining a non-root user for the application process to run as.
- Environment Variables: Storing sensitive information in environment variables outside the image.

In RHACS, build-time policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.

. Export the following variables to make our life easier

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export QUAY_USER={quay_admin_username}
export QUAY_URL=$(oc -n quay-enterprise get route quay-quay -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS={acs_route}
----

IMPORTANT: Verify that the variables are correct

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
echo $ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS
----

[start=3]
. Login to Quay

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
podman login $QUAY_URL
----

NOTE: Use the quay admin credentials, Username: *{quay_admin_username}* & password: *{quay_admin_password}*. You can create unique user and group credentials in Quay for proper segmentation.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image check --image=ubuntu:latest
podman push ubuntu:latest --remove-signatures
----

IMPORTANT: We are using the "image check" CLI option.

Now ACS didn't break the command since there is no enforcement through roxctl currently. Let's make a copy of the build and deploy-time policy and enforce during the build phase.

.Procedure
. Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy* then *Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.

NOTE: This time we are going to edit a different policy. Specifically related to the *Build & Deploy* phases.

[start=3]

. Click on the *Ubuntu Package Manager in Image* options (The three dots on the right side of the screen) and select *Clone policy*

IMPORTANT: Make sure to *CLONE* the policy

image::acs-deploy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]

. Give the policy a new name. Something you will remember. The best practice would be to add a description for future policy enforcers as well. For example;

image::acs-deploy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Next, update the policy to *inform and enforce* while clicking on the deploy stage only.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to unselect the *DEPLOY* lifecycle before moving forward.

image::acs-deploy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]

Now, we want to target our specific deployment with an image label.

. Click on the *Policy criteria* tab.
. Click on the *Deployment metadata* dropdown on the right side of the browser.
. Find the *Namespace* label and drag it to the default policy criteria.
. Type *default* under the namespace criteria

Your policy should look like this,

image::acs-deploy-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=10]

. Lastly, go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes

NOTE: There is a preview tab on the right side of the page that will show you all of the affected applications with the introduction of this policy.

image::acs-deploy-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=12]

. Click Save

Now let's test it out! 

. Run the following in the terminal

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image check --image=ubuntu:latest  --compact-output 
podman push ubuntu:latest --remove-signatures
----

*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
+--------------------------------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
WARN:   A total of 4 policies have been violated
ERROR:  failed policies found: 1 policies violated that are failing the check

== Report and Resolve Violations

In this last section. We will resolve a few of the issues that we have created.

*Procedure*

. Navigate to the *Violations* page.
. Filter by the policy violation *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* OR by the most recent policy violations. You will see a build deploy and runtime policy violation that has been enforced 1 time.

image::05-violations-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Violations Menu]

. Click the most recent violation and explore the list of the violation events:

If configured, each violation record is pushed to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration and is available to be retrieved via the API. The forensic data shown in the UI is recorded, including the timestamp, process user IDs, process arguments, process ancestors, and enforcement action.

After this issue is addressed, in this case by the RHACS product using the runtime enforcement action, you can remove it from the list by marking it as *Resolved*.

[start=4]

. Lastly, hover over the violation in the list to see the resolution options and resolve this issue.

image::acs-violations-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Resolve Violations]

For more information about integration with SIEM tools, see the RHACS help documentation on external tools.

== Understand Violations

Violations taken together determine _risk_, which you covered in previous labs.
In this lab, you explore how to determine the details of those violations to plan and implement their remediation.
The *Violations* view allows you to see these details.

Using RHACS, you can view policy violations, drill down to the actual cause of the violation, and take corrective actions.

The built-in policies identify a variety of security findings, including vulnerabilities (CVEs), violations of DevOps best practices, high-risk build and deployment practices, and suspicious runtime behaviors.
You can use the default out-of-the-box security policies or your own custom policies.

=== Examine Violations Overview

.Procedure
. From the left navigation menu, select the *Violations* tab:
+
image::rhacs_violations_overview.png[RHACS Violations Overview]

=== Examine Build and Deployment Time Violations

Build-time and deployment-time events occur only once--when the build or deployment is created in the system.
This is distinct from runtime events, which occur during the lifetime of the containers.
In this section, you examine what these violation events look like, and the policy that they violated.

.Procedure
. In the filter bar, find the `Policy: Fixable Severity at least Important`.
+
Expect to see a list of violation events.
They are the events captured during build and deploy time.
+
. From the list, click one of the violation events.
. Click the *Policy* tab:
+
// image::rhacs_violations_deployment_events.png[RHACS Violations - Deploy Time]
image::05_violation_01.png[RHACS Violations - Policy]
+
The *Policy Details* page includes a detailed description, rationale, and remediation for the violation.
Note that *Lifecycle Stage* is set to `Build, Deploy`.
This is the same information presented in a CI/CD tool or developer console when using build-time integration.

=== Examine Runtime Violations

Runtime violations have a different set of details and actions available.
The forensic data recorded is familiar to most incident response teams--the _who, what, when, where, and why_ of the activity--including for example, process names, arguments, UIDs, and container IDs.
In this case, for your lab, there is no enforcement of the action, just a notification, and the team has options to resolve or suppress these notifications in the future.

.Procedure
. From the left navigation menu, select the *Violations* tab.
. Create a `Policy: Ubuntu Package Manager Execution` filter to find an example runtime policy:
+
image::rhacs_violations_runtime_ubuntu.png[RHACS Violations - Runtime]
+
. Under *Entity*, select the violation with the `visa-processor in "production/payments"`, and expect the *Violation Detail* page to appear.
. Examine the _runtime_ *Violation events* to see that they look considerably different from the _deploy-time_ events.
The _who, what, when, where, and why_ are all present:

== Conclusion

Sweet!

In summary, we made use of the features provided by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes to display potential security violations in your cluster in a central dashboard. You crafted both deploy-time and runtime policies to help prevent malicious events from occurring in our cluster. Hopefully this lab has helped demonstrate to you the immense value provided by RHACS and OpenShift Platform Plus. Please feel free to continue and explore the RHACS lab environment.

On to *CI/CD and Automation*!
