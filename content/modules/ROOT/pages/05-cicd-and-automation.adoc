= CI/CD and Automation

== Module goals
* Trigger build-time violations for images and deployments on the command line and CI/CD pipelines
* Enforce a container image vulnerability violation at build time
* Codify an image vulnerability violation enforcement in a pipeline
* Explore warnings about deployment attributes from the command line


== Implementing Security Checks into your CI/CD pipeline

Implementing CI/CD security in container builds involves more than just securing your contianer images and your deployment manifests. There are several best practices to ensure that your containerized applications are secure throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

* Access Control: Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit who can modify the pipeline and deploy applications.
* Audit Logging: Enable and regularly review audit logs to monitor access and changes to the CI/CD pipeline.
* Official and Verified Images: Always start with official images from trusted sources (e.g., Docker Hub, Red Hat, Ubuntu).
* Minimal Base Images: Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface (e.g., alpine).
* Static Analysis: Integrate static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk) into the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities in the code.
* Image Scanning: Use tools like Clair, Anchore, or Trivy to scan container images for known vulnerabilities before deploying them.
* Pin Dependencies: Specify exact versions of dependencies to avoid introducing unverified or vulnerable components.
* Regular Updates: Keep dependencies and base images updated to their latest versions to benefit from security patches.
* Environment Variables: Avoid hardcoding secrets in the source code. Use environment variables or secret management tools.
* Secret Management Tools: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets to securely manage and inject secrets.
* Policy as Code: Use tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) to define and enforce security policies as code within your CI/CD pipeline.
* Compliance Checks: Automate compliance checks to ensure all deployments adhere to security standards and policies.

Now, RHACS can be implemented into any CI/CD process as a step in the build-deploy-run lifecycle. RHACS is able to acheive this through the *roxctl CLI* and the *admission controller*. RHACS can implement those image scanning, env variables and compliance checks into those pipelines.  

Let's take a look at a very simple CI/CD pipeline in OpenShift would look like.

== Review a basic CI/CD pipeline

In this section, we will review a simple pipeline that has been configured in Red Hat^(R)^ OpenShift Pipelines. 

Red Hat^(R)^ OpenShift Pipelines is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) solution that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. It leverages Tekton, a powerful and flexible open-source framework, to create cloud-native pipelines that integrate seamlessly with OpenShift and other Kubernetes environments. This enables developers to define and manage their build and deployment workflows as code, ensuring consistency, scalability, and repeatability across the software development lifecycle.

.Procedure
.Head over to the OpenShift Console. If you don't have access follow the steps below. If you do proceed to the following section.

=== Access the Red Hat^(R)^ OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) web console 

First, make sure you can access the Red Hat^(R)^ OCP console web console.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Log into the OCP console at `{web_console_url}`
. Click the *rhsso* option

image::01-ocp-login-admin.png[OpenShift console]

[start=3]
. Enter the OCP credentials 

[cols="1,1"]
|===
*User:*| {openshift_admin_user} |
*Password:*| {openshift_admin_password} |
|===


[start=4]
. Enter the OpenShift username *{openshift_admin_user}* and password: *{openshift_admin_password}*

image::01-ocp-login-password.png[OpenShift console login]


|====
You should be directed to the RHACM dashboard. RHACM is intergrated into the OpenShift dashboard.
|====

[start=5]
. To get to your clusters local OpenShift dashboard click the top dropdown and select *local-cluster*

image::06-cd-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
image::06-cd-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]
. Click on the *Pipelines* tab on the left side of the page and select "*Pipelines*" 

image::06-cd-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

|====
You should see all of the default pipelines that Red Hat OpenShift and it's operators use to update or fetch information. Most of these have not been run and are simply configuration files. 
|====

[start=7]
. The pipeline we are looking for is called *rox-pipeline* and you can either find it and select it or you can change the *Project to "pipeline-demo"*.

image::06-cd-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

We haven't run the pipeline yet so let's start one.

[start=8]
. Click the three dots on the right side of the screen and select *start*

image::06-cd-5.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

|====
This pipeline works by taking and image that you have created and passing it through a "roxctl image scan" and a "roxctl image check" process.
|====

[start=9]
. Let's use the *ubuntu:latest* image that we used in the previous module.

image::06-cd-6.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: The pipeline should fail. 

|====
Why do you think the pipeline failed?
|====

Let's look at the logs.

[start=10]
. Take a look at the log snippet on the bottom right of the page.

image::06-cd-9.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: ROX_CENTRAL_ENDPOINT
Getting roxctl
chmod: cannot access './roxctl': No such file or directory
/tekton/scripts/script-0-ftdft: line 5: ./roxctl: No such file or directory
----

This snippet indicates that there are incorrect variables. With RHACS, API access is required to query Central for results.

Let's take a look at the secret file necessary for *OpenShift Pipelines*.

[start=11]
. Run the following in the terminal.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
ls $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ ls $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines
pipeline  secrets  tasks
----

As you can see, the pipelines are broken up into one pipeline, with three tasks that need a secret file. Let's take a look at what variables are needed for the pipeline.

[start=12]
. Run the following in the terminal.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ cat $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
apiVersion: v1
stringData:
  rox_central_endpoint: "$ROXCTL_CENTRAL_ENPOINT"
  # The address:port tuple for StackRox Central (example - rox.stackrox.io:443)
  rox_api_token: "$API_TOKEN"
  # StackRox API token with CI permissions
  # Refer to https://help.stackrox.com/docs/use-the-api/#generate-an-access-token
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: roxsecrets
  namespace: pipeline-demo
----

Ok. So need the RHACS Central endpoint and a API token with the right permissions. Luckily we have the RHACS Central endpoint handy.

Yours is {acs_route} but you can run the following command to update the rox-secrets file with your unique route.

[start=13]
. Run the following in the terminal.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
ACS_URL=$(oc -n stackrox get route central -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
ACS_URL_PORT=$(echo "$ACS_URL" | sed 's/$/:443/')
sed -i "s|ROXCTL_CENTRAL_ENDPOINT|$ACS_URL_PORT|g" $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
----

[start=14]

. Verify by running the following command

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ cat $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
apiVersion: v1
stringData:

  # The address:port tuple for StackRox Central (example - rox.stackrox.io:443)
  rox_api_token: "API_TOKEN"
  # StackRox API token with CI permissions

kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: roxsecrets
  namespace: pipeline-demo
type: Opaque
----

== Get an API token from RHACS 

Just like the title says.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Head back to the RHACS dashboard and on *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations* and scroll to the bottom of the page.

image::06-cd-10.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on *API Token.
. Click on *Generate token*
. Give your token a name, select *Continuous Integration* as the Role and set an expiration date and hit *Generate*

image::06-cd-11.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: The role of CI has read only access to the RHACS Central Services. You can setup other roles but there are a few default roles like Admin, Analyst and Continuous Integration.

[start=5]
. Now either save the API Token into the `$TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml` file and replace *API_TOKEN* or export the variable and use SED with the following commands.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export ACS_API=
----

[start=6]
. Then run

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
sed -i "s|API_TOKEN|$ACS_API|g" $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
----

[start=7]
. And verify that your file is ready by running the following and getting a similar output. 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ cat $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
apiVersion: v1
stringData:
  rox_central_endpoint: "central-stackrox.apps.cluster-mjh4d.sandbox1834.opentlc.com:443"
  # The address:port tuple for StackRox Central (example - rox.stackrox.io:443)
  rox_api_token: "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Imp3dGswIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJFeHBpcmVBdCI6IjIwMjQtMDUtMjRUMDQ6MDA6MDBaIiwiYXVkIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdGFja3JveC5pby9qd3Qtc291cmNlcyNhcGktdG9rZW5zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzE2NTIzMjAwLCJpYXQiOjE3MTY1MTA4MzAsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RhY2tyb3guaW8vand0IiwianRpIjoiMTMxNmMwMGQtM2Q4Mi00NTVmLWJmNzktMzYyNzlmZTc5MWY1IiwibmFtZSI6ImNpY2QtdG9rZW4iLCJyb2xlcyI6WyJDb250aW51b3VzIEludGVncmF0aW9uIl19.Uxz2w8d_PPwS85bL4IuchaXVybBM80fSYQ2X6zAm69fNv72unXq_tne0amsrdbSlbzqE-MY9xKoLLfp0O7Y4jh0rN10g9G301M4Ure0uoXRe5X62Iso3_MBIDMY-JiZCqZ7dnHChgRj1bt7BOsLS1MOK-uGXlzFZlGDXZ_TVk0yqkyJUu-7oIq1Rd-UZJzL8FFkAUwPra33gQ_3bJJeZvbNmxFKalXoEhuLzOmrThGXqLG5Pnp5lg-6OOsFVfWbbe-HzeXAkY1qWD4GSPpaeiuqPXzmdc6N7EElpLyZzXyEUSQfqZc1SY0Rqe-8vR_qD0sk8Z8bwmbFXZ0lpyHVkLSlLBiyqeIuT8ReNPMxtYjFXnbHvrLy518TVPZYCleoz90gRuPNvkMjpp3rdXAodFNwjxW7-D8MxpMSlzMUTsoO9DiRM28ER5mU2OC5i6qeGhz0mTkwBtkmLW6Rcc54Xm6E2jPOWAi4PzK1CNGLlozfyQtCyZ0ljJ1aYOwe44Z-kEeYkd9QSjJIt2X4w4kpykimn03DEacfR-oq_2smI5J-PdcR_fUs6SZw7BdlTMx8rZcnnNDIAbOooinb0ggpDYjk2e2fbVe-ZWFtxidGApOkTDPVHiYzYqgBWCSWrqEK70spg7YTnvsuQC22DyEKRhfw7ikj5qZtO7H9L_-MfrdM"

type: Opaque
----

[start=8]
. Lastly apply the following and head over to the OpenShift Console

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/secrets/rox-secrets.yml
secret/roxsecrets configured
----

=== Let's try again

.Procedure
. Let's make sure that you are looking at the pipeline we ran before.

image::06-cd-12.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click the *Actions* dropdown and select *Rerun*. Then relax for a few seconds and grab a sip of water. 

image::https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeXdiMmFwaTNrbW02cTNod3BmaTh2aGRrdDJsc3d4NHpqNXY5ZzkwNiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/073QSCJf2tIbtWjZpb/giphy.gif[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, class="center"]

image::06-cd-13.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

|====
What happened? Did you expect this behavior?
|====

[start=3]
. Check the log snippet in bottom right of the page.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
--------------------------------+
WARN:	A total of 4 policies have been violated
ERROR:	failed policies found: 1 policies violated that are failing the check

ERROR:	checking image failed after 3 retries: failed policies found: 1 policies violated that are failing the check
----

So it looks like our build policy from the previous exercise impacted the ability to complete this pipeline run. 

== A task to complete on your own.

*Here is your mission*

image::https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNnJoNHE2MXhocm52ZzFmeHVyY3JiN3F5cGFjYW00dGsycXF2bnNtbyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3ohs4lNKssQD2wewyQ/giphy.gif[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, class="center"]

*Should you choose to accept it*

Turn off the enforcement of the build lifecycle policy blocking this pipeline and rerun the pipeline.

IMPORTANT: Do not disable the policy. Disable the enforcement.

Your mission is completed with a successful pipeline run.

image::06-cd-14.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


== What would you do?

* How would you implement roxctl into your pipelines?
* Would you have enforcement off at the beginning?
* Are there any organizational policies that should be enforced in all pipelines?

== Summary

THUMBS UP!

In this lab, you review a basic CI/CD use case that implemented the build policy from the previous module. You then adjusted the policy so the pipeline would succeed. 

Congrats! On to Compliance!
