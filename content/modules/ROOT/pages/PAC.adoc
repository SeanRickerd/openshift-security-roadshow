## Hands-On Walk-Through: Managing Policies as Code in RHACS

This guide provides a step-by-step walk-through to help you explore and demo managing policies as code in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS). This hands-on approach will give you a practical understanding of configuring and managing policies using Kubernetes-native tools like Argo CD.

### What is Policy as Code?

Policy as code enables you to define and manage security policies as Kubernetes custom resources (CRs). These policies can be applied to clusters using continuous delivery (CD) tools such as Argo CD. This approach allows Kubernetes security architects to define policies in YAML or JSON, providing an alternative to using the RHACS portal.

### Key Features
- **Create custom policies locally**: Author policies in YAML or JSON files and use GitOps workflows to manage them.
- **Use continuous delivery tools**: Leverage Argo CD or other GitOps tools to deploy and manage policies across clusters.
- **Monitor policy drift**: Understand and resolve discrepancies between policies stored in Kubernetes and RHACS.

#### Configure Argo CD for Policy as Code
1. **Install the RHACS Configuration Controller**: This is automatically installed in the `stackrox` namespace when RHACS is deployed.
2. **Set Up Argo CD Communication**:
   - Configure Argo CD to interact with the RHACS controller via the Kubernetes API.
   - Ensure Argo CD monitors the namespace where RHACS Central is installed.

#### **3. Enable GitOps Integration (Optional)**
For workflows that do not use Argo CD:
- Use the RHACS API to connect your GitOps repository (e.g., GitHub) directly to Central.
- Manage policies as CRs stored in your repository.

### **Creating Policies as Code**

#### **Option 1: Using the RHACS Portal**

1. **Create or Clone a Policy**:
   - Navigate to the Policy Management page.
   - Create a new policy or clone an existing default policy.
2. **Save as a Custom Resource (CR)**:
   - Click the kebab (overflow menu) next to the policy.
   - Select **Save as Custom Resource**.
   - For bulk saving, use **Bulk Actions** > **Save as Custom Resources**.
3. **Apply the Policy CR**:
   - Use `kubectl apply` or `oc apply` to deploy the CR to the namespace where Central is installed:

     ```bash
     $ kubectl apply -f your-policy.yaml
     ```
   - Alternatively, push the CR to the namespace using Argo CD or another GitOps tool.

#### **Option 2: Manually Authoring a Policy CR**

1. **Construct the CR**:
   - Use a text editor to define the policy as a Kubernetes CR with the following attributes:

     ```yaml
     kind: SecurityPolicy
     apiVersion: config.stackrox.io/v1alpha1
     metadata:
       name: short-name
     spec:
       policyName: A longer form name
       # ...
     ```
   - Use `kubectl explain securitypolicy.spec` for field definitions.
2. **Apply the Policy CR**:
   - Use `kubectl apply` or `oc apply`:

     ```bash
     $ kubectl apply -f your-policy.yaml
     ```
   - Or push the CR to the namespace via Argo CD or GitOps.

### **Understanding Policy Drift**

Policy drift occurs when the version of a policy in RHACS Central does not match the version in Kubernetes. Drift can happen when changes are made directly in the RHACS portal or API rather than updating the CR.

> **Note:** Drift is resolved automatically within 10 hours. To avoid drift, always modify policies through their corresponding CRs.

---

### **Disabling the Policy as Code Feature**
The policy as code feature is enabled by default but can be disabled if needed.

#### **Procedure**
- **Operator Method**: Set the `spec.configAsCode.configAsCodeComponent` field to `Enabled`.
- **Helm Method**: Set `configAsCode.enabled` in the `values.yaml` file to `true`.
- **Manifest Method**:

  Delete the configuration controller deployment:

  ```bash
  $ kubectl -n stackrox delete deployment config-controller
  ```

  Replace `kubectl` with `oc` if using OpenShift.

### **Wrap-Up and Next Steps**

This hands-on demo provides an overview of managing policies as code in RHACS. Practice creating, managing, and resolving policy configurations using both the RHACS portal and manual methods. For additional details, consult the [official RHACS documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.6/operating/manage_security_policies/custom-security-policies.html#policy-as-code-about_custom-security-policies).

== Understand Violations in RHACS

Violations taken together determine _risk_, which you covered in previous labs. In this lab, you explore how to determine the details of those violations to plan and implement their remediation.

The *Violations* view allows you to see these details.

Using RHACS, you can view policy violations, drill down to the actual cause of the violation, and take corrective actions.

The built-in policies identify a variety of security findings, including vulnerabilities (CVEs), violations of DevOps best practices, high-risk build and deployment practices, and suspicious runtime behaviors.
You can use the default out-of-the-box security policies or your own custom policies.

== Report and Resolve Violations

In this last section. We will resolve a few of the issues that we have created.

*Procedure*

. Navigate to the *Violations* page.
. Filter by the policy violation *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* OR by the most recent policy violations. You will see a build, deploy and runtime policy violation that has been enforced one time.

[start=3]
. Click the most recent violation and explore the list of the violation events:

If configured, each violation record is pushed to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration and is available to be retrieved via the API. The forensic data shown in the UI is recorded, including the timestamp, process user IDs, process arguments, process ancestors, and enforcement action.

After this issue is addressed, in this case by the RHACS product using the runtime enforcement action, you can remove it from the list by marking it as *Resolved*.

[start=4]

. Lastly, hover over the violation in the list to see the resolution options and resolve this issue.
