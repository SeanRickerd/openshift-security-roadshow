=== RHACS basics

RHACS provides the tools and capabilities to address the security needs of a cloud-native development approach on Kubernetes. These security features represent any developer or administrator’s primary work across various environments, including multiple datacenters, private clouds, or public clouds that run Kubernetes clusters.

=== RHACS features

Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, you can gain comprehensive Kubernetes security that includes the following use cases:

- *Visibility:* See your entire landscape of images, registries, containers, deployments, and runtime behavior.
- *Vulnerability* Management: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes across the entire software development life cycle.
- *Compliance:* Audit your systems against CIS Benchmarks, NIST, PCI, and HIPAA, with interactive dashboards and one-click audit reports.
- *Network Segmentation:* Visualize existing connections and enforce tighter segmentation using Kubernetes-native controls to reduce your blast radius.
- *Risk Profiling:* See all your deployments ranked by risk level, using context from Kubernetes' declarative data, to prioritize remediation.
- *Configuration Management:* Apply best practices for Docker and Kubernetes to harden your environment for a more secure and stable application.
- *Threat Detection:* Use rules, automated allow lists, and baselining to identify suspicious activity in your running applications accurately.
- *Incident Response:* Take action, from failing builds and blocking deployments to killing pods and thwarting attacks, using Kubernetes for enforcement.

== Introduction to the RHACS console

The first section of this lab will focus on navigation and vulnerability management. This work will take place in the UI and require you to use both the dashboard and the lab environment.

=== Navigating the RHACS console

In this section, you familiarize yourself with the RHACS portal, including its tabs, search capabilities and dashboard functionality.

The RHACS dashboard has four main sections:

. Navigation bar
. Navigation drawer
. Dashboard

image::acs-numbered-dashboard.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Numbered Dashboard]

=== Navigation bar

The top bar contains the following functionality: 

- Global search 
- Command-line tools 
- Cluster health 
- Documentation 
- API reference 
- Enable dark/light Mode 
- Logged-in user account

image::acs-top-bar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Navigation Bar]

=== 1. Global Search

The ability to instantly find resources is essential to safeguard your cluster. Utilize the RHACS search feature to find relevant resources faster.

For example, you can use it to find deployments exposed to a newly published CVE or all deployments with external network exposure.

A search query consists of two parts:

- An attribute that identifies the resource type you want to search for.
- A search term that finds the matching resource.

For example, to find all violations in the *ctf-web-to-system* deployment, the search query is *Deployment:ctf-web-to-system*.

In this search query, Deployment is the attribute, and ctf-web-to-system is the search term.

NOTE: The search field in RHACS requires each attribute to be entered fully as a search term. Enter your first attribute, and hit the <tab> key to move along to the following attribute you would like to enter. Results will appear once they match the entered query.

image::acs-search-ctf-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Syntax]

NOTE: RHACS maintains a library of searchable assets to help you search faster, they will appear in a drop-down list, and you can click on them to enter them as well. If a specific CVE or deployment cannot be found, please confirm the spelling of the asset name or that it is correctly deployed in the cluster. 

==== Common search queries

Here are some common search queries you can try in the RHACS search bar if you’d like to test its functionality.

|============
|Query|Example|Purpose
|CVE:<CVE_number>|CVE:CVE-2018-11776|Finding deployments that are affected by a specific CVE
|Privileged:<true_or_false>|Privileged:true|Finding privileged running deployments
|Exposure Level:<level>|Exposure Level:External|Finding deployments that have external network exposure
|============

image::acs-search-cve.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Syntax]

NOTE: This is just a sample of the types of queries you can use to analyze your environment in RHACS. For additional examples of search queries, please see the RHACS documentation.

==== Local page filtering

You can use local page filtering from within all views in the RHACS portal. Local page filtering works similarly to the global search, but only relevant attributes are available. You can select the search bar to show all available attributes for a specific view.

=== 2. Navigation menu

image::acs-nav-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Navigation Menu]

The left-hand navigation menu provides access to each of the security use cases, as well as product configuration to integrate RHACS with your existing tooling. The navigation menu has the following items:

- Dashboard: Summary view of your environment
- Network Graph: Configured and actual network flows and the creation of Network Policies to implement network segmentation
- Violations: Events that do not match the defined security policies
- Compliance (2.0): Our new compliance dashboard update is in progress. With plans to make compliance reporting even easier with tailored compliance profiles and reporting by application, namespace and cluster. 
- Compliance (1.0): Several industry and regulatory security standards, such as PCI DSS, our default dashboard.
- Vulnerability Management (2.0): We are in the process of migrating our vulnerability management dashboard to focus on triaging by vulnerability. This is to help identify what layer contains vulnerability. Whether it be the node, cluster or application.
- Vulnerability Management (1.0): Information about known vulnerabilities affecting your environment, including deployed workloads and infrastructure, risk acceptance and reporting.
- Configuration Management: Identification of potential misconfigurations that can lead to security issues
- Risk: Risks affecting your environment, such as suspicious executions
- Platform Configuration: RHACS configuration, policy management and integration details, including;
* Clusters
* Policy Management
* Collections
* Integrations
* Access Control
* System Configuration
* Administration Events
* System Health

=== 3. Dashboard 

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. It contains additional navigation shortcuts and actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on the data that matters most to you. You can view information about levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images.

image::acs-dashboard-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Center Dashboard]

v
The main dashboard is your place to look at the vulnerabilities, risk, compliance, and policy violations across your clusters and namespaces. This section addresses all of the functionality in the main dashboard to help you navigate it more effectively in the future.
The dashboard can be broken down into three main sections:

. The status bar
. The dashboard filter
. The actionable widgets

image::acs-dashboard-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Three Dashboard Sections]

==== 1. The status bar

The status bar provides at-a-glance numerical counters for critical resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope, defined by the roles associated with your user profile. 

These counters are clickable, providing fast access to the desired list view pages as follows:

|============
|Counter|Destination
|Clusters|Platform Configuration -> Clusters
|Nodes|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Nodes
|Violations|Violations Main Menu
|Deployments|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Deployments
|Images|Vulnerability Management -> Dashboard -> Images
|Secrets|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Secrets
|============

==== 2. The dashboard filter 

The dashboard includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select clusters and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope.

NOTE: The dashboard filter does not affect the status bar, and when no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to All.

image::acs-dashboard-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Filter]

image::acs-dashboard-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Drop-down]

==== 3. Actionable widgets

If you have time, adjust the dashboard filtering options and widgets to hone the filtering capabilities.

With these widgets, you can customize the information displayed on the dashboard by default in order to find the items that you consider most important to your deployments and your business' security.

== Navigating the main use cases

=== Network 

We are going to work from the top down throughout the ACS dashboard to give you an overview of all of the use cases that ACS will cover, starting with the network UI.

image::00-network-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Filter]

The network user interface contains two drop-downs: the network graph tab and the listening endpoints tab. 

The network graph tab allows you to visualize all the network connections in your cluster look at Baseline flows simulate Network policies manage CIDR blocks and more

image::00-network-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Filter]

The listening endpoints tab allows you to see all of the deployments across all of your clusters and audit for any reported listening endpoints as you drill down through cluster namespace and into deployments, you will see the exact process ID Port protocol pod ID and container name and if they are exposed.

image::00-network-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Filter]

=== Violations 

On to the violations tab.

The violations tab is where you will manage all of your policy violations. The violations tab is excellent for managing policy violations in the workflow. 

It contains:
 - The exact policy that was violated 
 - The Entity that violated the policy 
 - the type 
 - if it is enforced 
 - the severity of that policy 
 - the category 
 - the life cycle 
 - and the time of the violation

image::00-violations-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Don't worry we'll go through this policy violation workflow in later modules.

=== Compliance 2.0

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes supports OpenShift Container Platform configuration compliance standards through an integration with the OpenShift Container Platform Compliance Operator. In addition, it allows you to measure and report on configuration security best practices for OpenShift and supported Kubernetes platforms.

The OpenShift Compliance Operator allows OpenShift Container Platform administrators to define the desired compliance state of a cluster and provides an overview of gaps and ways to remediate any non-compliant policy. We will be installing and managing the compliance operator in  later modules

image::00-compliance-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The compliance 2.0 tab is in tech preview this was just released in ACS 4.4, and we are currently in the process of migrating The existing 1.0 dashboard into 2.0

=== Compliance 1.0

The compliance 1.0 dashboard should be empty when you're in here for the first time. It's because you have not completed a scan.

image::00-compliance-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

We will go into this in a later module, but for now, hit the *Scan environment* button in the top right of the page to kick off your first scan. 

image::00-compliance-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Ensure you see the bar graphs fill up with data before moving. We we will dissthesethis compliance results in a later module

=== Vulnerability Management 2.0

Next, we have the vulnerability management 2.0 tab, similar to the compliance 2.0 tab  vulnerability management is currently getting an overhaul.

image::00-vuln-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The vulnerability management 2.0 tab contains a workload cve Tab and a vulnerability reporting tab with the workload CV tab currently in Tech preview

image::00-vuln-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Feel free to click around however we will be exploring the vulnerability management section in the upcoming module

=== Vulnerability Management 1.0

The Vulnerability Management 1.0 tab has the original vulnerability management dashboard and the risk acceptance workflow.

image::00-vuln-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The underlying vulnerability data is the same as how we display, categorize and show it to the user. It is essential to to manage vulnerabilities at scale and make them actionable, which is a high priority in ACS. This is why we're prioritizing the vulnerability management workflow and eventually moving all features and functionality into a single tab

image::00-vuln-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Again, feel free to click around however we will be exploring the vulnerability management section in the upcoming module.

=== Configuration Management

The Configuration Management tab contains a bunch of information about the security configuration across your OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters

image::00-config-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


This information includes:

- Policy violations by severity
- Specific standards like the CIS Kubernetes 1.5 standard
- Users with the most cluster admin roles
- Secrets used across deployments

=== Risk

Another risk tab is a combination of security configuration management Network detection run time and incident response and vulnerability management all coming together so that users can gain a greater context and prioritize security issues throughout OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters

image::00-risk-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

In this tab you can review risk indicators deployment details and look at process discoveries such as runtime processes in a container all of this information is designed to help you gain a greater understanding of the priority of specific workloads in your cluster as security is not only vulnerability management

image::00-risk-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== Platform Configuration

RHACS configuration, policy management and integration details, including;
** Clusters:*

image::00-pc-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Where you can manage your clusters, check out cluster status, watch your credential expiration manager delegated scanning, and onboard your clusters via init bundles 

==== Policy Management

image::00-pc-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The policy management tab is where you manage well … all of your policies. many of default policies are built into ACS, but this is where you will clone, edit, and create all of your policies via the UI

==== Collections

image::00-pc-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

In the collections tab, you can configure deployment collections to associate with other workflows to create a collection and then apply a policy directly to that collection of containers/deployments/clusters. This workflow and this tab will help you scale and manage your policies across clusters, groups, regions, or whatever it is you're seeking to apply specific policy, reporting, and compliance standards to

==== Integrations

image::00-pc-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The integration tab holds all of your options for:
- Image integration 
- Signature Integrations 
- Notifier Integrations 
- Backup Integrations 
- Cloud Source Integrations 
- and authentication tokens

==== Access Control

image::00-pc-5.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The access control tab is where you set up your authentication providers and the roles that you would like to have an ACS, along with permission sets and access scopes.

==== System Configuration

image::00-pc-6.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The system configuration tab manages things like private data retention configuration cluster deletion public configuration and all of these are settings are editable

==== Administration Events

image::00-pc-7.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The administration events tab is handy for troubleshooting platform issues by reviewing event logs now, these logs are approached after four days by default, but you can change that in the system configuration tab. We will have a whole section on the administration events later, but it is beneficial for diagnosing issues and looking into domains such as authentication image scanning Integrations and more 

==== System Health

image::00-pc-8.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

And lastly, the system Health Tap will help you handle things like Administration usage, generate diagnostic bundles that you monitor cluster status sensor upgrades, credential expiration, and more.
