== Accessing the EKS cluster 

I have checked the environment and it is has both eks and openshift cluster. Both are accessible using cli only need to change the context by using following command:

````bash
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context admin
oc config use-context eks-admin
````
Let us know if we can help anywhere else.

oc config use-context admin
oc patch central.platform.stackrox.io stackrox-central-services -n stackrox --patch ‘{“spec”:{“scannerV4":{“scannerComponent”:“Default”}}}’ --type=merge
