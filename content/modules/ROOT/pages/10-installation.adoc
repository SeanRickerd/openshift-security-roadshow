== Accessing the EKS cluster 

I have checked the environment and it is has both eks and openshift cluster. Both are accessible using cli only need to change the context by using following command:

````bash
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context admin
oc config use-context eks-admin
````
Let us know if we can help anywhere else.

kubectl set resources deployment sensor -c=sensor --requests=cpu=100m,memory=256Mi --limits=cpu=2,memory=2Gi -n stackrox


Check that the pod is up and running:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
{podname}   1/1     Running   0          5s
----

Then let's go into the running pod to execute some commands:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl exec -ti {podname} /bin/bash
----

NOTE: Change the pod name with your pod name.
