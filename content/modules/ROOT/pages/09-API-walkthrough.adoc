== RHACS API Overview 

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) for Kubernetes provides a robust API that allows users to programmatically interact with the platform. This API enables automation, integration, and customization of various security operations within the Kubernetes environment.

=== API Endpoints

The RHACS API offers various endpoints for different functionalities such as policies, clusters, deployments, and compliance. Common endpoint categories include */v1/policies*, */v1/clusters*, */v1/deployments*, and */v1/compliance*. The API typically uses JSON for both requests and responses. Ensure that your API client is capable of handling JSON data.

=== Authentication

The API uses token-based authentication. You need to obtain an API token from the RHACS console to authenticate API requests.

=== Common Operations:

* GET: Retrieve information (e.g., list of policies, details of a specific deployment).
* POST: Create new resources (e.g., create a new policy).
* PUT: Update existing resources (e.g., modify an existing policy).
* DELETE: Remove resources (e.g., delete a policy).

== Interacting with the RHACS API

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Head back to the RHACS dashboard and on *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations* and scroll to the bottom of the page.

[start=2]
. Click on *API Token.
. Click on *Generate token*
. Give your token a name, select *Admin*, since we are going to need full access to RHACS Central
. Click *Generate*
. Now it's time to export the API token as a variable for the roxctl CLI. 

IMPORTANT:Be sure to put the AP token in the correct location.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
ACS_URL="$(oc -n stackrox get route central -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
ACS_URL_PORT=$"https://$ACS_URL"
API_TOKEN=your_api_token
----

[source,bash]
----
echo $ACS_URL
echo $ACS_URL_PORT
echo $API_TOKEN
----

=== Make API Requests

Use a tool like curl, Postman, or a programming language with HTTP client libraries (e.g., Pythonâ€™s requests library) to interact with the API.

*Example Using curl where you get a list of policies*

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

----
curl -H -k "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" $ACS_URL_PORT/v1/clusters
----

*Example Using curl where you create a new policy*

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
curl -X POST "$ACS_URL/v1/policies" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "New Policy",
  "description": "Description of the new policy",
  "policyDefinition": {
    // policy details
  }
}'
---- 

*Example using curl where you update a policy*

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
curl -X PUT "$ACS_URL/v1/policies/{policy_id}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "Updated Policy Name",
  "description": "Updated description"
}'
----

*Example using curl where you delete a policy*

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
curl -X DELETE "$ACS_URL/v1/policies/{policy_id}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
----

== Documentation and Resources

The official RHACS API documentation provides detailed information on all available endpoints, request formats, and responses. This is available within the RHACS console.

Review the API and come up with your own use case that can help automate your day-to-day workflows.

We'll discuss after the module is done.

You've made it through the Roadshow! There are a few extra modules for you to work through.

Thank you for all of your hard work!
